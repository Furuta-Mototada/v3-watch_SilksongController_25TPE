## 🚀 Next Steps: Training Your Model

### Step 1: Upload Data to Google Drive (5 minutes)

1. **Create folder structure in Google Drive:**
   ```
   My Drive/
   └── silksong_data/
       ├── 20251017_125600_session/
       │   ├── sensor_data.csv
       │   └── 20251017_125600_session_labels.csv
       ├── 20251017_135458_session/
       │   ├── sensor_data.csv
       │   └── 20251017_135458_session_labels.csv
       ├── 20251017_141539_session/
       │   ├── sensor_data.csv
       │   └── 20251017_141539_session_labels.csv
       └── 20251017_143217_session/
           ├── sensor_data.csv
           └── 20251017_143217_session_labels.csv
   ```

2. **Upload files:**
   - Go to [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com)
   - Create the `silksong_data` folder
   - For each session in `src/data/continuous/`:
     - Create session subfolder
     - Upload `sensor_data.csv`
     - Upload `[session]_labels.csv`

   **Quick upload tip:** Zip each session folder locally, upload to Drive, then extract there.

### Step 2: Open Google Colab (2 minutes)

1. Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)

2. **Upload the training notebook:**
   - Click: File → Upload notebook
   - Upload: `notebooks/Colab_CNN_LSTM_Training.ipynb`

3. **Enable GPU acceleration:**
   - Click: Runtime → Change runtime type
   - Hardware accelerator: **GPU**
   - GPU type: **T4** (default, free)
   - Click: **Save**

   **⚡ This is critical!** Training takes 20-40 minutes with GPU vs 2-4 hours without.

---

### Step 3: Run Training (20-40 minutes with GPU)

**Just execute the cells in order!** The notebook is fully automated.

#### Cell 1: Mount Google Drive
- Authorizes Colab to access your Drive
- Click the link and copy the authorization code

#### Cell 2: Check GPU
- Verifies GPU is available
- Should show: `✅ GPU is enabled!`

#### Cell 3: Install Dependencies
- Imports TensorFlow, NumPy, etc.
- Takes ~30 seconds

#### Cell 4: Configure Paths
- **⚠️ Important:** Verify the `SESSION_FOLDERS` list matches your uploaded folders

#### Cell 5: Load Data
- Reads all sensor data and labels
- Creates sliding windows
- Should show ~20,000-30,000 training windows

#### Cell 6: Train/Val/Test Split
- 70% training, 15% validation, 15% test

#### Cell 7: Build Model
- Creates CNN/LSTM architecture
- ~214K parameters

#### Cell 8: Train Model
- **This is the long step:** 20-40 minutes
- Watch the progress bar
- Validation accuracy should reach >90%

#### Cell 9-11: Evaluate
- Shows accuracy plots
- Confusion matrix
- Classification report

#### Cell 12: Save Model
- Saves `cnn_lstm_gesture.h5` to your Drive
- **This is your trained model!**

### Step 4: Download Trained Model (1 minute)

1. In Google Drive, navigate to: `silksong_data/cnn_lstm_gesture.h5`
2. Right-click → Download
3. Move to your project:
   ```bash
   mv ~/Downloads/cnn_lstm_gesture.h5 /Users/cvk/Downloads/CODELocalProjects/v3-watch_SilksongController_25TPE/models/
   ```

---

### Step 5: Test Real-Time Recognition (2 minutes)

1. **Start the recognition system:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/cvk/Downloads/CODELocalProjects/v3-watch_SilksongController_25TPE/src
   python udp_listener_v3.py
   ```

2. **Start your Android watch app** (sends sensor data via UDP)

3. **Test gestures:**
   - Walk around (default state)
   - Jump (should trigger within 10-30ms)
   - Punch (rapid recognition)
   - Turn (rotation detection)
   - Stand idle (recognized as idle/walk)

4. **What to expect:**
   - **Latency:** 10-30ms (super fast!)
   - **Accuracy:** 90-98%
   - **Console output:** Real-time predictions
   - **Action triggers:** When confidence >80%

---

## 🎯 Expected Results

### Model Performance
- **Training accuracy:** 95-98%
- **Validation accuracy:** 90-95%
- **Test accuracy:** 90-93%
- **Inference speed:** 10-30ms per prediction

### Per-Gesture Accuracy
Based on similar datasets:
- **Jump:** 92-96% (very distinctive)
- **Punch:** 88-94% (fast motion)
- **Turn:** 85-92% (rotation-based)
- **Walk:** 93-97% (default state, abundant data)
- **Noise:** 80-88% (catchall category)

### Common Confusion Pairs
- Punch ↔ Noise (rapid random motions)
- Idle ↔ Walk (minimal movement)
- Turn ↔ Walk (slow rotations while walking)

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No GPU detected"
**Solution:**
1. Runtime → Change runtime type → GPU
2. Restart the notebook
3. Re-run from Cell 1

### Issue: "File not found" when loading data
**Solution:**
1. Check Google Drive folder names match exactly
2. Make sure files uploaded completely
3. Verify path in Cell 4: `/content/drive/MyDrive/silksong_data`

### Issue: Low accuracy (<80%)
**Possible causes:**
1. **Insufficient data:** Need more recording sessions
2. **Label quality:** Review transcriptions for errors
3. **Class imbalance:** Need more of certain gestures
4. **Sensor calibration:** Check Android app sensor readings

**Solution:**
- Collect 2-3 more sessions (10 minutes each)
- Focus on under-represented gestures
- Re-run the training

### Issue: Model doesn't trigger actions
**Solution:**
1. Check confidence threshold in `udp_listener_v3.py` (default 80%)
2. Lower threshold to 70% for testing:
   ```python
   CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = 0.70  # In udp_listener_v3.py
   ```
3. Check UDP connection (Android app → Python listener)
4. Verify model file loaded correctly

## 📊 Understanding Your Training Results

### Training Curves

**Good training:**
```
Accuracy: Train ↗️ 95%, Val ↗️ 92% (close together)
Loss: Train ↘️ 0.15, Val ↘️ 0.20 (decreasing)
```

**Overfitting (bad):**
```
Accuracy: Train ↗️ 98%, Val ↗️ 85% (wide gap)
Loss: Train ↘️ 0.08, Val ↗️ 0.35 (diverging)
```
*Solution:* More data, more dropout, less epochs

**Underfitting (bad):**
```
Accuracy: Train ↗️ 75%, Val ↗️ 73% (both low)
Loss: Train ↘️ 0.60, Val ↘️ 0.62 (both high)
```
*Solution:* More epochs, bigger model, better features

### Confusion Matrix Interpretation

**Example:**
```
           jump  punch  turn  walk  noise
jump       0.94   0.03  0.01  0.01   0.01   ← 94% correct
punch      0.02   0.91  0.01  0.02   0.04   ← 91% correct
turn       0.01   0.02  0.88  0.07   0.02   ← 88% correct
walk       0.01   0.01  0.03  0.94   0.01   ← 94% correct
noise      0.02   0.08  0.02  0.03   0.85   ← 85% correct
```

**Interpretation:**
- Diagonal = correct predictions (higher is better)
- Off-diagonal = confusions
- Noise confused with punch (8%) → need more distinct noise examples

## 🎓 What You're Actually Training

### Input
- **50 timesteps** (1 second of motion at 50Hz)
- **9 features** per timestep:
  - Accelerometer: X, Y, Z
  - Gyroscope: X, Y, Z
  - Magnetometer: X, Y, Z (if available)

### Model Architecture
```
Raw Sensor Window (50×9)
       ↓
CNN Layer 1: Detects basic patterns (sharp peaks, curves)
       ↓
CNN Layer 2: Combines patterns (jump signature, punch rhythm)
       ↓
LSTM Layer 1: Models temporal sequences (jump → land, walk cycle)
       ↓
LSTM Layer 2: Refines understanding (transition patterns)
       ↓
Classification: Output probabilities for 5 gestures
```

### Why This Works Better Than Phase IV (SVM)

| Aspect | Phase IV (SVM) | Phase V (CNN/LSTM) |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Features** | 60+ hand-crafted | Learned automatically |
| **Temporal** | No memory | LSTM remembers context |
| **Data** | 40 clips/gesture | Continuous recordings |
| **Speed** | 300-500ms | 10-30ms |
| **Accuracy** | 85-95% | 90-98% |
