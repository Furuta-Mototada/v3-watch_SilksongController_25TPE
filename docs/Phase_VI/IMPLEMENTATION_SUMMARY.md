- Live sensor value display (acceleration, gyroscope, rotation)
- Connection status for both Watch and Phone apps (green/red indicators)
- Data rate metrics (packets per second)
- Recording status (shows when button is held)
- Statistics tracking (recordings per gesture type)
- Freshness indicators (shows if data is current or stale)
- Full-screen terminal UI that updates every 0.5 seconds

**Usage**:
```bash
cd src
python data_collection_dashboard.py
```

**Why it's better than the original**:
- Immediately see if data is flowing (no more guessing!)
- Verify sensor values are NOT zeros
- Confirm both devices are connected
- Real-time feedback when pressing buttons

### 2. `src/inspect_csv_data.py` üîç

- Calculates sample count and data rate
- Shows sensor type distribution
- Provides clear verdict: ‚úÖ "real data" or ‚ùå "all zeros"

**Usage**:
```bash
python src/inspect_csv_data.py data/button_collected/*.csv
```

**Example output**:
```
‚úÖ Total samples: 112

üìä Sensor types:
   gyroscope                :   37 samples

## How It Solves the User's Problem

### Original Problem
> "ive clicekd a lot of button at this point but its still not creating data what is wrong"

### Root Issues Identified
1. ‚ùå No visibility into whether data is actually flowing
2. ‚ùå Can't tell if Watch app is sending real data or zeros
3. ‚ùå Unclear how both Android apps coordinate
4. ‚ùå No tools to verify CSV file quality

### Solutions Implemented

#### 1. Real-time Visibility ‚Üí Dashboard
**Before**: No way to see if data is coming in
**After**: Dashboard shows:
- Connection status (connected/disconnected with colors)
- Live sensor values (updates every 0.5s)
- Data rate (50 Hz = good, 0 Hz = problem)
- Freshness (green = current, red = stale)

**Impact**: User can immediately see if Watch app is sending real data!

#### 2. Data Quality Verification ‚Üí CSV Inspector
**Before**: Had to manually open CSV files and check for zeros
**After**: `inspect_csv_data.py` automatically:
- Checks for non-zero values
- Reports statistics
- Gives clear verdict (‚úÖ or ‚ùå)

**Impact**: User can verify data quality after collection in seconds!

#### 3. Understanding Coordination ‚Üí Documentation
**Before**: Unclear why two Android apps are needed
**After**: `ANDROID_COORDINATION_GUIDE.md` explains:
- Watch app streams sensors (continuous)
- Phone app sends labels (button presses)
- Python buffers and saves when labeled

**Impact**: User understands the system architecture!

#### 4. Troubleshooting ‚Üí Verification Guide
**Before**: Trial and error, no systematic debugging
**After**: `DATA_COLLECTION_VERIFICATION.md` provides:
- Step-by-step verification
- Common problems with solutions
- Success criteria checklist

**Impact**: User can systematically diagnose and fix issues!

## Technical Highlights

### Dashboard Architecture
- **Threading**: Background thread updates UI while main thread handles UDP
- **Non-blocking**: Uses `socket.settimeout(0.5)` for responsive UI
- **Thread-safe**: Uses `threading.Lock()` for buffer access
- **Rate tracking**: `deque(maxlen=50)` for rolling window calculations

### Data Format Clarification
**Key insight**: Each UDP packet contains ONE sensor reading, not all three!

```json
// Watch sends THREE separate packets per cycle:
{"sensor": "linear_acceleration", "values": {"x": -0.15, "y": -0.23, "z": 0.89}}
{"sensor": "gyroscope", "values": {"x": 0.02, "y": -0.04, "z": 0.01}}
{"sensor": "rotation_vector", "values": {"x": -0.01, "y": 0.02, "z": 0.01, "w": 0.99}}
```

CSV structure correctly stores each packet as a row with its sensor type.

### CSV Inspector Logic
- Counts non-zero values per sensor type
- Calculates statistics (mean, std, range)
- Checks timestamp progression
- Provides actionable verdict

### 2. Test with Watch Only
```bash
# Start dashboard
python data_collection_dashboard.py

# Open Watch app, enable streaming
# Dashboard should show:
# ‚úì Watch CONNECTED (green)
# ‚úó Phone DISCONNECTED (red)
# Sensor values updating (NOT zeros)
```

### 3. Test with Both Devices
```bash
# Start dashboard
# Connect watch
# Connect phone
# Press ENTER when prompted
# Hold a button on phone
# Dashboard should show "üî¥ RECORDING: [ACTION]"
# Release button
# Should show "‚úÖ READY" and counter increment
```

### 4. Test CSV Inspector
```bash
# After collecting some data
python src/inspect_csv_data.py data/button_collected/*.csv

# Should report:
# - Sensor type distribution
# - Non-zero value counts
# - Statistics
# - Overall verdict
```
