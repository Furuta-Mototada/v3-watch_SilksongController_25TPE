# Android & Python Fixes - October 19, 2025 2:40am

## 🎨 Android UI Improvements

### 1. Vibrant Color Palette
Replaced boring gray buttons with vibrant, action-specific colors:
- **WALK**: Bright Blue (#2196F3)
- **IDLE**: Purple (#9C27B0)
- **PUNCH**: Deep Orange/Red (#FF5722)
- **JUMP**: Yellow (#FFEB3B) with black text for contrast
- **TURN_LEFT**: Cyan (#00BCD4)
- **TURN_RIGHT**: Pink (#FF4081)
- **Recording State**: Bright Neon Green (#00E676)

### 2. Enhanced Reset Button
- Vibrant hot pink color (#E91E63)
- Larger size (56dp height)
- Prominent styling with emoji: "🔄 RESET ALL COUNTS"
- Enhanced elevation for better visual feedback
- Bold text for better readability

### 3. Better Visual Feedback
- Increased default button elevation from 2dp to 4dp
- Recording elevation remains at 8dp for clear distinction
- Count colors remain: Red (<10), Yellow (10-29), Green (30+)

## 🐍 Python Backend Improvements

### 1. Connection Detection & ENTER Button
**Problem**: No way to know if both devices are connected before starting collection.

**Solution**:
- Tracks watch connection (sensor data packets)
- Tracks phone connection (label event packets)
- Displays real-time connection status:
  ```
  🔍 Waiting for connections...
     📱 Watch app: Waiting...
     📲 Phone app: Waiting...
  ```
- Once both connected, shows:
  ```
  🎉 Both devices connected!
     📊 Sensor packets: 142
     📱 Label events: 3

  ============================================================
  ✨ READY TO START DATA COLLECTION ✨
  ============================================================

  👉 Press ENTER to begin collecting data...
  ```
- **Only starts recording after user presses ENTER**
- Connection health monitoring (5-second timeout detection)

### 2. Actual Sensor Data Parsing
**Problem**: Python script was receiving data but not parsing or saving it.

**Solution**:
- Now properly parses all sensor data fields:
  - `accel_x`, `accel_y`, `accel_z`
  - `gyro_x`, `gyro_y`, `gyro_z`
  - `rot_x`, `rot_y`, `rot_z`, `rot_w`
  - `timestamp_ns`, `sensor` type
- Buffers all sensor data in memory (last 30 seconds)
- Saves actual sensor data to CSV files (not placeholders)
- Progress updates during baseline noise capture

### 3. Improved Data Collection Flow
```
1. Start script → Listen for connections
2. Watch connects → Show "✅ Watch connected"
3. Phone connects → Show "✅ Phone connected"
4. User presses ENTER → Begin 30s baseline noise capture
5. Ready for button presses → Real-time recording
6. Ctrl+C → Save all recordings with actual sensor data
```

### 4. Enhanced Logging
- Real-time sensor sample counts
- Progress updates every 5 seconds during baseline
- Shows number of samples saved per recording
- Connection status for both devices
- Better visual feedback with emojis

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### Android (MainActivity.kt)
**File**: `Android_2_Grid/app/src/main/java/com/example/grid_watch_udp_datacollector/MainActivity.kt`

**Changes**:
1. Line 236-280: Updated `ActionButton` colors with vibrant palette
2. Line 110-125: Enhanced reset button styling

### Python (button_data_collector.py)
**File**: `src/button_data_collector.py`

**Changes**:
1. Lines 24-55: Added connection tracking variables
2. Lines 67-160: Complete rewrite of `start()` with:
   - Connection detection loop
   - ENTER prompt when ready
   - Non-blocking socket with timeout
   - Health monitoring
3. Lines 162-215: Rewrote `handle_message()` to:
   - Parse all sensor fields
   - Buffer sensor data properly
   - Track connection timestamps
4. Lines 269-308: Updated `save_recording()` to:
   - Extract sensor data from time window
   - Save actual data (not placeholders)
   - Report sample counts
5. Lines 310-358: Fixed `segment_and_save_noise()` to handle proper data structure
6. Lines 376-397: Updated `_save_noise_segment()` to save actual sensor data

## 🚀 How to Test

### Android App
1. Open in Android Studio
2. Build and deploy to phone
3. Notice the vibrant button colors
4. Test the new reset button styling
5. Press and hold buttons - see neon green recording state

### Python Script
1. Start watch app streaming sensor data
2. Run: `cd src && python button_data_collector.py`
3. Watch for connection messages
4. Start phone app
5. When both connected, you'll see the ENTER prompt
6. Press ENTER to begin collection
7. Hold buttons on phone while performing gestures
8. Check `data/button_collected/` for CSV files with real sensor data

## 🎯 What's Fixed

✅ Android UI now vibrant and colorful (no more boring grays!)
✅ Reset button is prominent and styled nicely
✅ Python waits for both connections before starting
✅ ENTER button only appears when ready
✅ Sensor data is now properly parsed and saved
✅ Real-time connection status monitoring
✅ CSV files contain actual sensor readings

---

## 📝 Notes

- Socket timeout set to 0.5s for responsive connection monitoring
- Connection health check every 5 seconds
- Sensor buffer holds last 30 seconds (1500 samples at 50Hz)
- Timestamps converted from milliseconds (phone) to nanoseconds (watch)
- Progress updates during baseline noise capture
- All sensor data properly structured and saved to CSV

Enjoy the vibrant colors and working data collection! 🎉
