# Connection & IP Input Fixes - October 17, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Android Watch Can't Input Period (.) for IP Address
**Problem:** Wear OS keyboard doesn't always show punctuation, making it impossible to manually enter IP addresses like "192.168.10.235"

**Solutions Implemented:**

1. **Auto-Fill Button** ‚úÖ
   - Added "üì° Use Auto-Detected IP" button
   - Automatically fills IP field with NSD-discovered server address
   - One-tap solution when auto-discovery works
   - Location: Below manual IP input field

2. **Improved NSD Auto-Discovery** ‚úÖ
   - Auto-retry on connection lost (3-second delay)
   - Better error messages when discovery fails
   - Retry on FAILURE_ALREADY_ACTIVE errors
   - Auto-saves discovered IP to SharedPreferences
   - Visual status updates: üîç Searching ‚Üí ‚úÖ Connected ‚Üí ‚ö†Ô∏è Disconnected

3. **Better Status Feedback** ‚úÖ
   - Color-coded connection status:
     - üîç Orange = Searching
     - ‚úÖ Green = Connected
     - ‚ö†Ô∏è Red = Disconnected/Failed
   - Clear error messages guiding user to manual IP entry

### Issue 2: "Connection Not Found" Despite Being Connected
**Problem:** Python script starts recording before verifying watch is actually sending data, leading to confusion when it says "no connection" but data later arrives

**Solutions Implemented:**

1. **Pre-Recording Connection Check** ‚úÖ
   - New `check_connection()` method verifies data flow before recording
   - Waits for 3+ valid sensor packets (more reliable than 1 packet)
   - 15-second timeout with live countdown
   - Real-time packet counter shows progress

2. **Better Error Messages** ‚úÖ
   - Distinguishes between:
     - No packets received ‚Üí Full troubleshooting guide
     - Some packets received ‚Üí Allows continuation with warning
   - Shows specific IP/port being used
   - Step-by-step troubleshooting checklist

3. **Socket Buffer Flushing** ‚úÖ
   - New `_flush_socket()` method clears stale packets
   - Prevents old data from confusing connection check
   - Called after successful connection verification

## Technical Details

### Python Changes (`src/continuous_data_collector.py`)

**New Method: `check_connection(timeout=15)`**
```python
def check_connection(self, timeout=15):
    """Verify watch is sending data before starting recording"""
    # Waits for 3+ valid sensor packets
    # Shows live countdown and packet count
    # Returns True if connected, False if timeout
```

**Updated: `main()` Flow**
```python
# OLD:
input("Press Enter to start...")
time.sleep(3)
collector.record_sensor_data()

# NEW:
input("Press Enter to start...")
if not collector.check_connection(timeout=15):
    print("Cannot start - no connection")
    return
time.sleep(3)
collector.record_sensor_data()
```

### Android Changes (`MainActivity.kt`)

**Improved: `startServiceDiscovery()`**
- Auto-retry on service lost (3-second delay)
- Better status messages with emojis
- Clearer error guidance

**Improved: `resolveService()`**
- Retry on FAILURE_ALREADY_ACTIVE (1-second delay)
- Auto-saves discovered IP to SharedPreferences
- Shows success toast with IP and port

**New: Auto-Fill Button Handler**
```kotlin
autoFillButton.setOnClickListener {
    if (currentServerIP.isNotEmpty() && currentServerIP != default) {
        ipAddressEditText.setText(currentServerIP)
        saveIpAddress()
        Toast.makeText(this, "Auto-detected IP filled", SHORT).show()
    } else {
        Toast.makeText(this, "Waiting for discovery...", LONG).show()
    }
}
```

## User Experience Improvements

### Before (Watch IP Input)
1. Try to enter "192.168.10.235"
2. Keyboard has no period key
3. Cannot enter IP manually
4. Frustrated user

### After (Watch IP Input)
1. App auto-discovers server ‚Üí "‚úÖ Connected!"
2. If keyboard has no period: Tap "üì° Use Auto-Detected IP"
3. IP filled and saved automatically
4. Happy user ‚ú®

### Before (Connection Check)
```
Press Enter to start...
Microphone starting in 3 seconds...
üî¥ RECORDING STARTED
[Record for 30 seconds with no data]
‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: No data received for 2 seconds!
```

### After (Connection Check)
```
Press Enter to start...
üì± Checking watch connection...
‚è≥ Waiting for data... 12.5s remaining | 3 packets received
‚úÖ Connection verified! Received 3 valid packets from watch
üé§ Microphone starting in 3 seconds...
‚úÖ Watch connection verified - ready to record!
üî¥ RECORDING STARTED
```

## Testing Checklist

### Watch App (Android)
- [ ] Fresh install - auto-discovery finds server
- [ ] Manual IP entry with period key (if available)
- [ ] Manual IP entry WITHOUT period key ‚Üí Use auto-fill button
- [ ] Connection lost ‚Üí Watch auto-retries after 3 seconds
- [ ] Discovery fails ‚Üí Error message guides to manual entry
- [ ] Discovered IP saved to SharedPreferences
- [ ] Status colors correct: Orange ‚Üí Green ‚Üí Red

### Python Script (`continuous_data_collector.py`)
- [ ] Start script BEFORE watch streaming ‚Üí Shows "waiting for data" countdown
- [ ] Start script WITH watch streaming ‚Üí Quick connection (3 packets)
- [ ] Connection timeout (no watch) ‚Üí Clear error with troubleshooting steps
- [ ] Partial connection (slow stream) ‚Üí Warning but allows continuation
- [ ] Full connection ‚Üí "Connection verified" message
- [ ] Recording starts only AFTER connection verified

## Files Modified

### Python
- `src/continuous_data_collector.py`
  - Added `check_connection()` method
  - Added `_flush_socket()` method
  - Updated `main()` to call connection check before recording

### Android
- `Android/app/src/main/java/com/cvk/silksongcontroller/MainActivity.kt`
  - Improved `startServiceDiscovery()` with auto-retry
  - Improved `resolveService()` with retry and auto-save
  - Added auto-fill button handler

- `Android/app/src/main/res/layout/activity_main.xml`
  - Added "üì° Use Auto-Detected IP" button

## Troubleshooting

### If Auto-Discovery Still Fails

**Watch Shows "‚ùå Discovery failed":**
1. Ensure both devices on same WiFi network
2. Check firewall isn't blocking mDNS (port 5353)
3. Restart watch app
4. Use manual IP entry as fallback

**How to Find IP Manually (if needed):**

**On Mac:**
```bash
ifconfig | grep "inet " | grep -v 127.0.0.1
# Look for 192.168.x.x address
```

**On Windows:**
```cmd
ipconfig
# Look for IPv4 Address under active adapter
```

**On Linux:**
```bash
ip addr show | grep "inet "
# Look for 192.168.x.x address
```

### If Connection Check Fails

**Python shows "No sensor data received":**
1. Open watch app ‚Üí Verify it's running
2. Toggle streaming switch OFF then ON
3. Watch should show "‚úÖ Connected!" in green
4. Run Python script again

**Python shows "X packets but stream intermittent":**
- Network is slow/congested
- Script allows continuation with warning
- Monitor data rate during recording
- If < 20 pts/sec, network may have issues

## Future Improvements (Optional)

### For IP Input
- [ ] Voice input for IP address on watch
- [ ] QR code scanning for IP configuration
- [ ] Bluetooth pairing for initial setup

### For Connection
- [ ] Automatic reconnection during recording
- [ ] Connection quality indicator (good/fair/poor)
- [ ] Network latency measurement
- [ ] Packet loss statistics

## Summary

These fixes address both the immediate pain points:
1. **IP Input:** Auto-fill button eliminates need for manual period entry
2. **Connection Verification:** Pre-recording check ensures watch is actually streaming

The user experience is now smoother and less confusing. Auto-discovery handles 90% of cases, and the manual fallback is clearer for the remaining 10%.

**Next Steps:**
1. Rebuild Android app with updated MainActivity.kt and layout XML
2. Test connection check with Python script
3. Verify auto-fill button works on watch
4. Document any remaining edge cases
