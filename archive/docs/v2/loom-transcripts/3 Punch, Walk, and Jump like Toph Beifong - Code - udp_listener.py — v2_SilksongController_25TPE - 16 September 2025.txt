Guys, what if I told you I just became the avatar? Where am I looking? Okay, that was clickbait, but it's possible. So, I'm really excited because I've not only fixed... Well, I haven't fine-tuned everything, so it's pretty sensitive. But after the walk, I implemented the punch via linear acceleration. The jump, even separately. suddenly by being subtle about the separation of when the software recognizes a punch versus a jump and so punch is just that and jump is specifically the z-axis here goes up jump and I've also incorporated the turn I finally learned how to use the gyroscope I say finally without any context because this has been one of the biggest struggles in my previous iteration but It works and let me just show you what I mean then we can talk about Avatar and I mean Last Airbender Avatar All of them are ready Start Punch Punch Jump And then turn There was supposed to be a turn Turn Turn turn detected maybe it's because oh right it should be in this mode that's interesting i'll fix it but what i had in mind is i could be like tough bay fong and be like an earthbender where it's like lift and then push the rock and then finally meet the boulder but i can't believe it it's i don't know with enough patience i got all the sensors i wanted working to be working in a span of two hours and so i just need to calibrate it and finally test it on silksong
