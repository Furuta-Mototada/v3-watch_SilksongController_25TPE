Chat, this is amazing. I've used and got permissions for the step sensor. So it's a low power, energy efficient way to detect stepping. And now as long as I'm walking, it's holding W. But notice as soon as I stop, release W. A bit too sensitive, but let's walk again. Let's walk again, walk again, walk again, walk again. Stop. Release W. This is amazing. And it's all done. Well, basically, I've abstracted the way, the sine waves, handling the sine waves and the physics of walking because it's a built-in thing. I just needed to get permissions for the activity, which is the same permission that the app Fitbit uses to track your steps. But yeah, it's very prone to faking. I could just swing my arms around and it's holding W. And I stop. And it released. And this is possible because of multi-threading. Yeah, we got threads here. I will stop. And I will stop.
