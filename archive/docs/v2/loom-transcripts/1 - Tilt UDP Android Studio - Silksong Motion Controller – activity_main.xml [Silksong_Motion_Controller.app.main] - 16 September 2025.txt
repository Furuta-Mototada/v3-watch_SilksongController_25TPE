hey everyone quickly documenting my progress for silksong controller and this is v2 because v1

wasn't as good but anyway i am slowly as inspired by downhill invention by valentino brittenberg

and prof watson's assistants i have incrementally and slowly added simple sensors

so previous view one which is the clash and idea dump and this is actually doing things

cautiously a test driven development technique enough about that the demo here will be having

specific access to our tilt sensor specifically our specifically our role and so let's see what we can do

why is this still here

So if I start this and I turn on the sensor screen, we can see that we have

a status bar. Why isn't this moving? There we go. A status bar. So right now it's kind of flat,

but if we go beyond -20 or to the left, we can see state here.

we can see that it's pressing A. And when it goes back, press D, press D, press D, press D.

And I'm pretty proud of that because a bit of context.

I started by having a button send a UDB packet and then started replacing buttons which switches

for a sensor oh i don't have the results anymore but data packet transfer so it happens and now

we're getting specific data which is this rotation sensor that's it
