# 🎯 THE "STRAY CATCHER" - RADICAL SIMPLIFICATION

## Executive Summary

**Date:** October 14, 2025
**Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED
**Impact:** 🚀 GAME-CHANGING

We have radically simplified the data collection protocol from an impractical **560 samples** to a focused, manageable **240 samples** by adopting the "Stray Catcher" philosophy.

---

## The Critical Insight

### The Problem With Over-Granularity

The previous 14-gesture protocol was asking the model to learn distinctions that **don't matter for our use case**:
- Does it matter if the model knows the difference between "typing" and "drinking"? **NO.**
- Does it matter if it can distinguish "coughing" from "stretching"? **NO.**

### What Actually Matters

We only need the model to answer ONE question:

> **"Is this one of the 4 sacred gestures (PUNCH, JUMP, TURN, WALK)? If not, IGNORE IT."**

This is the **"Stray Catcher"** concept - a single, powerful NOISE class that catches everything else.

---

## The New Protocol

### The 5-Class Problem

```
Class 1: PUNCH  →  40 samples
Class 2: JUMP   →  40 samples
Class 3: TURN   →  40 samples
Class 4: WALK   →  40 samples
Class 5: NOISE  →  80 samples (oversampled for robustness)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TOTAL:            240 samples (~75 minutes)
```

### Why This Is Better

**Before (14-gesture protocol):**
- ❌ 560 samples required
- ❌ 14 different gesture definitions to remember
- ❌ 2-3 hours of data collection
- ❌ Exhausting and error-prone
- ❌ Over-granular distinctions that don't improve the model

**After (Stray Catcher protocol):**
- ✅ 240 samples required (57% reduction!)
- ✅ 5 simple, focused classes
- ✅ ~75 minutes of data collection
- ✅ Manageable in a single session
- ✅ Laser-focused on what matters

## The NOISE Class Design

### Philosophy

The NOISE class is **intentionally diverse**. Each of the 80 NOISE samples will be a **different type** of confounding movement, selected from these categories:

### Category 1: Resting & Stillness
- Remain completely still (baseline "no motion")
- Relaxed breathing, no arm movement
- This is the "true negative" - no gesture at all

### Category 2: Daily Tasks
- Typing on keyboard (small wrist movements)
- Lifting hand to mouth (drinking motion)
- Using watch hand as if holding/scrolling phone
- Adjusting glasses or hair

### Category 3: Involuntary Motions
- Coughing or sneezing (sharp body jolt)
- Shrugging shoulders firmly
- Stretching arm overhead or forward

### Category 4: Checking & Fidgeting
- **CRITICAL:** Rotating wrist to check time on watch
- Small, random wrist rotations (fidgeting)
- Scratching other arm or head with watch hand

### Category 5: False Starts
- Weak, incomplete punch (hesitant, not committed)
- Partial jump (shift weight but don't hop)
- Small turn (<90 degrees, not full turn)

### Implementation

During data collection, the script will **randomly prompt** for different NOISE types across the 80 samples. This ensures:
- **High intra-class variance** (the NOISE class is diverse)
- **Representative coverage** of common confounding patterns
- **No user fatigue** from repetitive identical motions

## Impact on Model Training

### Simpler Confusion Matrix

**Before (14×14):**
- 196 cells to interpret
- Difficult to identify where model struggles
- Many irrelevant class distinctions

**After (5×5):**
```
              PUNCH  JUMP  TURN  WALK  NOISE
Actual PUNCH  [  40    0     0     0     0  ]
Actual JUMP   [   0   40     0     0     0  ]
Actual TURN   [   0    0    39     1     0  ]
Actual WALK   [   0    0     0    38     2  ]
Actual NOISE  [   1    0     1     0    78  ]
```

**Instantly readable.** You can see at a glance:
- Model correctly classifies almost all target gestures
- A few NOISE samples confused as target gestures (acceptable)
- A few target gestures confused as NOISE (may need threshold tuning)

### Class Balance Strategy

**The NOISE class is oversampled (80 vs 40 per target class).** This is intentional:
- NOISE is the hardest class to learn (most diverse)
- We want to bias the model toward **caution** (fewer false positives)
- It's better for the model to miss a weak punch than to trigger on a cough

During training, we may use **class weights** to balance this:
```python
class_weights = {
    0: 2.0,  # PUNCH (weight higher to compensate for fewer samples)
    1: 2.0,  # JUMP
    2: 2.0,  # TURN
    3: 2.0,  # WALK
    4: 1.0   # NOISE (already has 2x samples)
}
```

## File Structure

### Session Directory
```
training_data/
└── session_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/
    ├── punch_sample01.csv ... punch_sample40.csv
    ├── jump_sample01.csv ... jump_sample40.csv
    ├── turn_sample01.csv ... turn_sample40.csv
    ├── walk_sample01.csv ... walk_sample40.csv
    └── noise_sample01.csv ... noise_sample80.csv
```

**Total: 240 CSV files** (much more manageable!)

### Verification Command
```bash
cd training_data/session_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/
ls -1 *.csv | wc -l
# Expected output: 240

# Count per class:
ls -1 punch*.csv | wc -l  # Should be 40
ls -1 jump*.csv | wc -l   # Should be 40
ls -1 turn*.csv | wc -l   # Should be 40
ls -1 walk*.csv | wc -l   # Should be 40
ls -1 noise*.csv | wc -l  # Should be 80
```

## Real-Time Controller Architecture

### The Inference Loop

```python
# In udp_listener.py (simplified pseudocode)
import joblib

# Load the 5-class model
model = joblib.load('silksong_model.pkl')
scaler = joblib.load('scaler.pkl')

# Class mapping
CLASS_MAP = {0: 'PUNCH', 1: 'JUMP', 2: 'TURN', 3: 'WALK', 4: 'NOISE'}

while True:
    # 1. Get sensor data from sliding window
    window_data = get_sensor_window()

    # 2. Extract features
    features = extract_features(window_data)

    # 3. Scale and predict
    scaled = scaler.transform([features])
    prediction = model.predict(scaled)[0]
    predicted_class = CLASS_MAP[prediction]

    # 4. Act ONLY on target gestures
    if predicted_class == 'PUNCH':
        press_key('attack')
    elif predicted_class == 'JUMP':
        press_key('jump')
    elif predicted_class == 'TURN':
        flip_direction()
    elif predicted_class == 'WALK':
        start_walking()
    # If prediction == 'NOISE', do NOTHING
```

**This is elegant, robust, and production-ready.**

## Data Collection Workflow

### Pre-Collection (5 minutes)
1. Review stance definitions
2. Verify watch connection
3. Clear physical space
4. Have water ready

### Collection Session (~75 minutes)
```
COMBAT Stance:
  → 40 × PUNCH samples (2.5s each)
  → ~5 min including breaks

NEUTRAL Stance:
  → 40 × JUMP samples (2.5s each)
  → ~5 min including breaks

TRAVEL Stance:
  → 40 × TURN samples (2.5s each)
  → ~5 min including breaks
  → 40 × WALK samples (2.5s each)
  → ~5 min including breaks

NEUTRAL/VARIED Stances:
  → 80 × NOISE samples (2.5s each, VARIED types)
  → ~15 min including breaks

TOTAL: ~35 min active recording + 40 min breaks/transitions = 75 min
```

### Post-Collection (5 minutes)
1. Verify file count: `ls -1 *.csv | wc -l` (expect 240)
2. Spot check files for integrity
3. Backup session directory
4. Proceed to Phase III!

## The Philosophy in One Sentence

> **"We don't need to teach the model what a cough IS. We need to teach it what a cough IS NOT."**

The NOISE class is a **negative example class**. It doesn't need to be precisely defined—it just needs to be **sufficiently diverse** that the model learns to recognize the 4 target gestures as DISTINCT from everything else.

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. ✅ Verify `data_collector.py` has the simplified 5-gesture definitions
2. ✅ Verify `NOISE_SAMPLES = 80` is set
3. ✅ Review the welcome message (should emphasize "Stray Catcher" concept)
4. ✅ Prepare physical space for data collection

### Data Collection
1. Run `python3 data_collector.py`
2. Follow the prompts for 240 samples
3. Monitor connection status (stay GREEN!)
4. Take breaks as needed—quality over speed

### After Collection
1. Verify 240 files exist
2. Proceed to Phase III: Machine Learning Pipeline
3. Train 5-class SVM with RBF kernel
4. Analyze 5×5 confusion matrix
5. Deploy to real-time controller

**Status:** ✅ **READY TO EXECUTE**
**Confidence Level:** 🔥 **MAXIMUM**
**This is the correct path forward.**
