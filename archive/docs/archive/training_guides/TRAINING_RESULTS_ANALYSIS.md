# Training Results & NaN Validation Loss Fix

## üéØ Training Completed Successfully!

Your model trained, but with some warnings. Here's what happened:

### Results Summary

| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **Training Accuracy** | 84.66% | ‚úÖ Good |
| **Validation Accuracy** | 84.30% | ‚úÖ Good |
| **Validation Loss** | NaN | ‚ö†Ô∏è Issue |
| **Training Epochs** | 11 (early stopped) | ‚úÖ Normal |
| **Best Model** | Saved at Epoch 1 | ‚úÖ Saved |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è The NaN Validation Loss Issue

### What Does It Mean?

`val_loss: nan` means the validation loss couldn't be calculated. This is usually caused by:

1. **Very small validation set** - Not enough samples to compute reliable loss
2. **Numerical instability** - Some predictions caused log(0) or similar
3. **Class imbalance** - One class dominates the validation set

### Why Did Training Still Work?

The model uses **validation accuracy** as the primary metric for early stopping and model checkpointing, so it continued training despite the NaN loss. The 84.3% validation accuracy is actually good!

---

## üîç Diagnosis

Based on your output:
- Training accuracy: 84.66% (very stable across epochs)
- Validation accuracy: 84.30% (locked at same value)
- **Problem:** Both metrics are suspiciously constant

This suggests:
1. **Possible overfitting to dominant class** (likely "walk" at 68%)
2. **Validation set may be too small or imbalanced**
3. **Model might be predicting mostly one class**

## ‚úÖ Quick Fix for Colab

Add this cell **before** training (after loading data, before model.fit()):

```python
# Check class distribution in train/val/test
print("\n" + "="*60)
print("CLASS DISTRIBUTION CHECK")
print("="*60)

print("\nTraining set:")
for i, gesture in enumerate(GESTURES):
    count = np.sum(y_train == i)
    pct = count / len(y_train) * 100
    print(f"  {gesture:8s}: {count:4d} ({pct:5.1f}%)")

print("\nValidation set:")
for i, gesture in enumerate(GESTURES):
    count = np.sum(y_val == i)
    pct = count / len(y_val) * 100
    print(f"  {gesture:8s}: {count:4d} ({pct:5.1f}%)")

print("\nTest set:")
for i, gesture in enumerate(GESTURES):
    count = np.sum(y_test == i)
    pct = count / len(y_test) * 100
    print(f"  {gesture:8s}: {count:4d} ({pct:5.1f}%)")

# Check for any issues
if len(y_val) < 100:
    print("\n‚ö†Ô∏è  WARNING: Validation set is very small (<100 samples)")
    print("   Consider increasing your total data or adjusting split ratios")

# Verify no NaN or inf in data
if np.any(np.isnan(X_train)) or np.any(np.isinf(X_train)):
    print("\n‚ùå ERROR: NaN or Inf values in training data!")
if np.any(np.isnan(X_val)) or np.any(np.isinf(X_val)):
    print("\n‚ùå ERROR: NaN or Inf values in validation data!")
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Better Solution: Use Class Weights

Add this **before** model.fit():

```python
# Calculate class weights to handle imbalance
from sklearn.utils.class_weight import compute_class_weight

class_weights_array = compute_class_weight(
    'balanced',
    classes=np.unique(y_train),
    y=y_train
)
class_weights = dict(enumerate(class_weights_array))

print("\n" + "="*60)
print("CLASS WEIGHTS")
print("="*60)
for i, gesture in enumerate(GESTURES):
    print(f"  {gesture:8s}: {class_weights[i]:.3f}")
```

Then update model.fit() to use them:

```python
history = model.fit(
    X_train, y_train,
    validation_data=(X_val, y_val),
    epochs=100,
    batch_size=32,
    callbacks=callbacks,
    class_weight=class_weights,  # ‚Üê ADD THIS LINE
    verbose=1
)
```

## üéì Understanding Your Results

### What Happened in Your Training

```
Epoch 1: 77.7% ‚Üí 84.7% accuracy (initial learning)
Epoch 2-11: Stuck at 84.66% (no improvement)
Early stopping at epoch 11
```

This pattern suggests:
- Model quickly learned to predict the **dominant class (walk = 68%)**
- Didn't improve further because it's already getting 68% right by just predicting "walk"
- The 84.3% validation accuracy might be inflated by class imbalance

### Expected Better Results

With class weights:
```
Epoch 1-5: 70-80% accuracy (learning all classes)
Epoch 5-15: 85-92% accuracy (fine-tuning)
Epoch 15-25: 92-95% accuracy (convergence)
Final: 90-95% validation accuracy (balanced across classes)
```

## üìä Full Evaluation (Run This Now!)

Even with the NaN loss, your model was saved. Evaluate it properly:

```python
# Evaluate on test set
test_loss, test_accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test, verbose=0)
print(f"\nüìä Test Accuracy: {test_accuracy*100:.2f}%")

# Get predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test, verbose=0)
y_pred_classes = np.argmax(y_pred, axis=1)

# Detailed classification report
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix

print("\n" + "="*60)
print("CLASSIFICATION REPORT")
print("="*60)
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred_classes, target_names=GESTURES))

# Confusion matrix
cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred_classes)
cm_normalized = cm.astype('float') / cm.sum(axis=1)[:, np.newaxis]

print("\nConfusion Matrix (Normalized):")
print("             ", "  ".join([f"{g:8s}" for g in GESTURES]))
for i, gesture in enumerate(GESTURES):
    print(f"{gesture:12s} ", end="")
    for j in range(len(GESTURES)):
        print(f"{cm_normalized[i,j]:8.2f}  ", end="")
    print()
```

This will show you:
- **Per-class accuracy** (is it good at all gestures or just "walk"?)
- **Confusion matrix** (which gestures get mixed up?)

## üöÄ Action Plan

### Option 1: Use Current Model (Quick)

Your model might actually work! Run the full evaluation above to check.

**If per-class accuracy is >75% for all gestures:**
- ‚úÖ Model is fine, use it!
- The NaN loss is just a logging issue
- Download and test in your app

**If model only predicts "walk":**
- ‚ùå Need to retrain with class weights

### Option 2: Retrain with Class Weights (Recommended)

1. Add class weight calculation (see above)
2. Update model.fit() to use `class_weight=class_weights`
3. Retrain (will take same 25-40 min)
4. Should achieve 90-95% balanced accuracy

### Option 3: Collect More Data

If retraining doesn't help:
- Record 2-3 more sessions (focus on jump, punch, turn, noise)
- This will balance the dataset better
- Retrain with all 7-8 sessions

## üìÅ Your Current Model

The model was saved as:
- `best_model.h5` (in Colab)
- Saved at **Epoch 1** (first epoch with 84.3% val accuracy)

**To download:**
```python
# In Colab
from google.colab import files
files.download('best_model.h5')
```

Or save to Drive:
```python
# Save to your Drive
model.save('/content/drive/MyDrive/silksong_data/trained_model_v1.h5')
print("‚úÖ Model saved to Google Drive!")
```

---

## üß™ Quick Test in Colab

Before downloading, test the model's predictions:

```python
# Test on a few random samples
import random

num_tests = 10
test_indices = random.sample(range(len(X_test)), num_tests)

print("\n" + "="*60)
print("RANDOM PREDICTION TESTS")
print("="*60)

for idx in test_indices:
    sample = X_test[idx:idx+1]  # Add batch dimension
    true_label = y_test[idx]

    pred = model.predict(sample, verbose=0)
    pred_label = np.argmax(pred)
    confidence = np.max(pred) * 100

    true_gesture = GESTURES[true_label]
    pred_gesture = GESTURES[pred_label]

    status = "‚úÖ" if pred_label == true_label else "‚ùå"
    print(f"{status} True: {true_gesture:8s} | Pred: {pred_gesture:8s} ({confidence:.1f}% confidence)")
```

## üí° Summary

1. **Your model trained** and achieved 84% accuracy
2. **NaN validation loss** is a warning but not fatal
3. **Run the evaluation code** to see if it actually works well
4. **If needed**, retrain with class weights for better balance
5. **Model is already saved** and can be downloaded

The most important thing now is to **run the full evaluation** to see the per-class performance. That will tell you if the model is actually good or just predicting "walk" all the time.

Want to proceed with evaluation or retrain with class weights?
