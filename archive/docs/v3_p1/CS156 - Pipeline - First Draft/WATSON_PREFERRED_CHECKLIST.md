- [ ] Advanced normalization (MVC normalization is good!)
- [ ] Hyperparameter tuning with grid search
- [ ] Compare multiple kernel types for SVM (RBF, polynomial, sigmoid)

### How to Document Flexibility
- [ ] **Cite what you used** - Reference papers, documentation
- [ ] **Explain why you chose it** - What problem does it solve?
- [ ] **Show how it works** - Write the equation or algorithm
- [ ] **Compare to baseline** - How much did it improve results?

## 📝 Report Structure & Presentation

### Word Count Guidance
- Target: ~1000-1500 words of prose

2. **Data Explanation** (what, how, why) ✓
3. **Methodology** (your pipeline, step-by-step)
4. **Results** (metrics, visualizations, interpretation)
5. **Discussion** (what worked, what didn't, why)
6. **Future Work** (what's next)
7. **References** (cite everything)

### Presentation Quality
- [ ] **Clean formatting** - Consistent style throughout
- [ ] **Section headers** - Logical flow and organization
- [ ] **No orphaned code** - Every code block has context

## 🎯 Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### From Ingrid's Assignment Example

❌ **Don't:**
- Use packages without explaining what they do
- Include 9 confusion matrices without explanation
- Skip mathematical documentation
- Assume reader knows techniques you're using
- Present results without interpretation

✅ **Do:**
- Document package functions you rely on
- Aggregate results into clear summaries
- Write out equations for all key techniques
- Explain everything, even "obvious" choices
- Always interpret your results

### Additional Warnings

❌ **Don't:**
- Use LLMs without safety net (no math = no credit)
- Only use library implementations (no learning demonstrated)
- Skip comparison with simpler baselines
- Ignore poor results (discuss failures!)
- Submit without testing every code cell

### What Makes an Assignment Stand Out

1. **Novel comparisons** - Compare multiple approaches systematically

## 🎓 Key Takeaway from Watson Preferred Session

> "Don't worry about winning everything. You got plenty of time for that. You got many races to run. Just make sure this one is a Noice, solid one that you're proud of."
>
> — Professor Watson

**Translation:** Aim for consistent 3s across all four objectives as your baseline. Excellence (4-5 scores) should come from depth in areas you're passionate about, not from trying to maximize everything.

For this first assignment, focus on:
1. ✅ Rock-solid fundamentals (no missing pieces)
2. ✅ Clear, complete explanations
3. ✅ One or two areas of depth/flexibility
4. ✅ Professional presentation

The data collection script (`data_collector.py`) you now have provides the foundation. Use it to capture high-quality data, then focus your energy on thorough analysis and clear communication.

**You've got this! 🚴‍♂️⚡**

#### OCT 17 FEEDBACK TA
"Great work on completing all the extension questions so far!

Noice start to your assignment! I can see many ways to develop this project and I like the use of GroupKFold to avoid overfitting. I'd recommend adding baseline models such as RSME/ Logistic Regression to show model improvement.

I'd also add a short "how it works” section for each model - what function/decision rule it learns, the objective/loss it minimizes (and how it’s optimized), and how key hyperparameters control regularization - the math behind it."
