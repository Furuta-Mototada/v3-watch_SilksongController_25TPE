# Section 5: Model Selection and Mathematical Underpinnings

## The Myth of "Model Choice": Why Algorithm Selection is Overrated

If you read tech journalism, you'd think choosing the right deep learning architecture is the key to ML success. Let me disabuse you of that notion: **model choice matters far less than data quality and feature engineering**. I could probably achieve 80% of my final accuracy with any reasonable classifier—logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, SVMs, or neural networks. The difference between a bad model and a good model on clean, well-featured data is maybe 5-10 percentage points. The difference between good data and bad data is whether your system works at all.

That said, I'm required to explain my model choices for this assignment. So let's be honest about why I picked what I picked:

1. **Support Vector Machines (SVMs)** for Phase III/IV: Fast training, interpretable, works with small datasets
2. **CNN/LSTM hybrid** for Phase V: State-of-the-art for time-series, leverages GPU acceleration, required for stretching beyond course material

Let's unpack the mathematics behind both.

## Model 1: Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier

### The Core Idea: Maximum-Margin Hyperplane

SVMs solve a simple geometric problem: **find the hyperplane that separates two classes with the maximum possible margin**.

**Visual Intuition (2D Example):**

Imagine plotting two gesture classes in 2D feature space (e.g., `accel_magnitude_mean` vs. `gyro_magnitude_std`). Many lines could separate them, but SVM chooses the one that maximizes the distance to the nearest points from each class:

```
     Class 0 (idle)          |          Class 1 (walk)
         ○  ○                 |                ●  ●
           ○                  |              ●
         ○                    |                ●
    ←──────── margin ─────────|──────── margin ────────→
                         Hyperplane
```

**Why Maximum Margin?**

Intuitively, the classifier with the largest margin is most "confident"—it's furthest from both classes, so small perturbations (noise) won't flip predictions. Statistically, this corresponds to better generalization: maximizing margin minimizes the VC (Vapnik-Chervonenkis) dimension, which bounds generalization error.

### Mathematical Formulation: The Hard-Margin Case

For linearly separable data, SVM solves:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{minimize} \quad & \frac{1}{2} \|w\|^2 \\
\text{subject to} \quad & y_i(w \cdot x_i + b) \geq 1 \quad \forall i
\end{aligned}
$$

Where:
- $w \in \mathbb{R}^d$ is the normal vector to the hyperplane
- $b \in \mathbb{R}$ is the bias (intercept)
- $x_i \in \mathbb{R}^d$ is the feature vector for sample $i$
- $y_i \in \{-1, +1\}$ is the class label

**Decision Rule:**

For a new sample $x$, predict class:

$$
\hat{y} = \text{sign}(w \cdot x + b)
$$

If $w \cdot x + b > 0$, predict class +1; otherwise, class -1.

**Geometric Interpretation of the Margin:**

The margin width is:

$$
\text{margin} = \frac{2}{\|w\|}
$$

Minimizing $\|w\|^2$ is equivalent to maximizing $2/\|w\|$ (the margin). The constraint $y_i(w \cdot x_i + b) \geq 1$ ensures all samples lie outside the margin boundaries.

### Soft-Margin SVM: Handling Non-Separable Data

Real data is never perfectly separable. We need to allow some misclassifications. The **soft-margin SVM** introduces slack variables $\xi_i \geq 0$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{minimize} \quad & \frac{1}{2} \|w\|^2 + C \sum_{i=1}^{n} \xi_i \\
\text{subject to} \quad & y_i(w \cdot x_i + b) \geq 1 - \xi_i, \quad \xi_i \geq 0 \quad \forall i
\end{aligned}
$$

Where:
- $\xi_i$ measures how much sample $i$ violates the margin
- $C > 0$ is the **regularization parameter** (penalty for violations)

**Interpretation:**

- **Large $C$**: Prioritize fitting training data (risk overfitting)
- **Small $C$**: Allow more misclassifications, prioritize margin (risk underfitting)

This is the classic **bias-variance trade-off** in ML:

$$
\text{Error} = \text{Bias}^2 + \text{Variance} + \text{Noise}
$$

$C$ controls where we land on this curve.

### The Kernel Trick: Nonlinear Decision Boundaries

Linear hyperplanes can't separate complex gesture classes (e.g., "jump" vs. "punch" have overlapping linear feature ranges). Solution: **map features to a higher-dimensional space** where they become linearly separable.

**Kernel Function:**

Instead of explicitly computing the transformation $\phi(x): \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^D$ (where $D \gg d$), we use the kernel trick:

$$
K(x_i, x_j) = \phi(x_i) \cdot \phi(x_j)
$$

The kernel computes the inner product in the high-dimensional space without ever constructing $\phi$ explicitly.

**Radial Basis Function (RBF) Kernel (Used in This Project):**

$$
K(x_i, x_j) = \exp\left(-\gamma \|x_i - x_j\|^2\right)
$$

Where:
- $\gamma = 1/(2\sigma^2)$ controls the "influence radius" of each training sample
- $\|x_i - x_j\|^2$ is the squared Euclidean distance between samples

**Intuition:**

The RBF kernel creates Gaussian "bumps" around each training sample. Samples close in feature space (small $\|x_i - x_j\|$) have high kernel values (near 1); distant samples have low kernel values (near 0).

**Hyperparameter $\gamma$:**

- **Large $\gamma$**: Narrow Gaussians, decision boundary follows training data closely (overfitting)
- **Small $\gamma$**: Wide Gaussians, smoother decision boundary (underfitting)

### Multiclass Extension: One-vs-Rest Strategy

SVMs are inherently binary. For 8-class gesture recognition, I use **One-vs-Rest (OvR)** decomposition:

1. Train 8 binary classifiers:
   - Classifier 1: "jump" vs. "not jump"
   - Classifier 2: "punch" vs. "not punch"
   - ...
   - Classifier 8: "idle" vs. "not idle"

2. At inference, run all 8 classifiers and pick the one with the highest confidence:

$$
\hat{y} = \arg\max_{c=1,...,8} \left( w_c \cdot x + b_c \right)
$$

Where $(w_c, b_c)$ are the parameters for classifier $c$.

**Alternative: One-vs-One (OvO)**

Train $\binom{8}{2} = 28$ binary classifiers for each pair of classes, then vote. I didn't use this because OvR is simpler and performed equivalently on this dataset.

### SVM Implementation Code

```python
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

# Define hyperparameter search space
param_grid = {
    'C': [0.1, 1, 10, 100],           # Regularization strength
    'gamma': ['scale', 0.001, 0.01, 0.1],  # RBF kernel width
    'kernel': ['rbf']                  # RBF kernel only
}

# Create SVM with OvR multiclass strategy
svm = SVC(
    kernel='rbf',
    decision_function_shape='ovr',  # One-vs-Rest
    probability=True,                # Enable probability estimates
    random_state=42
)

# Grid search with 5-fold cross-validation
grid_search = GridSearchCV(
    svm,
    param_grid,
    cv=5,
    scoring='f1_macro',  # Macro-averaged F1 (treats all classes equally)
    n_jobs=-1,            # Use all CPU cores
    verbose=1
)

# Train on prepared data
grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Best hyperparameters found
best_svm = grid_search.best_estimator_
print(f"Best C: {best_svm.C}, Best gamma: {best_svm.gamma}")
print(f"Best CV F1: {grid_search.best_score_:.3f}")
```

**Hyperparameter Tuning Results:**

After grid search, optimal parameters were:
- **C = 10**: Moderate regularization
- **gamma = 0.01**: Moderate kernel width

Cross-validation F1 score: **0.82** (binary), **0.73** (multiclass)

## Model 2: CNN-LSTM Hybrid for Deep Learning (Phase V)

### Why Go Beyond SVM?

SVMs have a fundamental limitation: **they discard temporal structure**. By computing time-domain statistics (mean, std, etc.) over 0.3-second windows, we treat each window as an **unordered bag of samples**. The sequential dynamics of gestures are lost.

Consider a "punch" gesture:
1. **T=0-100ms**: Acceleration onset (arm begins moving forward)
2. **T=100-200ms**: Peak velocity (arm fully extended)
3. **T=200-300ms**: Deceleration (arm returns to rest)

SVM sees: `accel_mean = 3.2 m/s²`. It doesn't know that acceleration spiked at T=100ms.

**Solution: Sequence models that preserve temporal ordering.**

### Architecture: Convolutional Neural Network + Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM)

This is a hybrid architecture that combines:
1. **Convolutional layers**: Extract local temporal patterns (e.g., "acceleration spike")
2. **LSTM layers**: Capture long-range sequential dependencies (e.g., "spike followed by decay")

```
Input: (batch_size, timesteps=15, features=6)
    ↓
[Conv1D layer 1] → filters=64, kernel_size=3, ReLU
    ↓
[MaxPooling1D] → pool_size=2 (downsamples to 7 timesteps)
    ↓
[Conv1D layer 2] → filters=128, kernel_size=3, ReLU
    ↓
[MaxPooling1D] → pool_size=2 (downsamples to 3 timesteps)
    ↓
[LSTM layer 1] → units=64, return_sequences=True
    ↓
[LSTM layer 2] → units=32, return_sequences=False
    ↓
[Dense layer 1] → units=64, ReLU
    ↓
[Dropout] → rate=0.5 (prevents overfitting)
    ↓
[Dense output] → units=8, Softmax (probability distribution over classes)
```

### Mathematical Breakdown: Convolutional Layer

A 1D convolutional layer applies a sliding window (kernel) across the time axis:

$$
\text{Conv1D}(x)_t = \sum_{k=0}^{K-1} w_k \cdot x_{t+k} + b
$$

Where:
- $w \in \mathbb{R}^K$ is the learned kernel (size $K$)
- $x_t$ is the input at time $t$
- $b$ is a bias term

**For multiple filters** (e.g., 64 in layer 1), this becomes:

$$
\text{Conv1D}(x)_{t,f} = \text{ReLU}\left( \sum_{k=0}^{K-1} w_{k,f} \cdot x_{t+k} + b_f \right)
$$

Where $f = 1, ..., 64$ indexes the filters, and:

$$
\text{ReLU}(z) = \max(0, z)
$$

**Intuition**: Each filter detects a specific temporal pattern. Filter 1 might respond to "rapid acceleration onset," Filter 2 to "smooth deceleration," etc. The network learns these patterns from data.

### Mathematical Breakdown: LSTM Layer

LSTMs solve the **vanishing gradient problem** that plagues vanilla RNNs. They maintain a cell state $C_t$ that can preserve information over long sequences.

**LSTM Equations (per timestep):**

$$
\begin{aligned}
f_t &= \sigma(W_f \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_f) && \text{(Forget gate: what to discard from cell state)} \\
i_t &= \sigma(W_i \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_i) && \text{(Input gate: what new info to add)} \\
\tilde{C}_t &= \tanh(W_C \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_C) && \text{(Candidate values)} \\
C_t &= f_t \odot C_{t-1} + i_t \odot \tilde{C}_t && \text{(Update cell state)} \\
o_t &= \sigma(W_o \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_o) && \text{(Output gate)} \\
h_t &= o_t \odot \tanh(C_t) && \text{(Hidden state output)}
\end{aligned}
$$

Where:
- $\sigma(z) = 1/(1 + e^{-z})$ is the sigmoid function (outputs [0,1])
- $\tanh(z) = (e^z - e^{-z})/(e^z + e^{-z})$ (outputs [-1,1])
- $\odot$ is element-wise multiplication (Hadamard product)
- $W_f, W_i, W_C, W_o$ are learned weight matrices

**Intuition:**

- **Forget gate $f_t$**: Decides what to erase from memory (e.g., "previous gesture ended, forget it")
- **Input gate $i_t$**: Decides what to add to memory (e.g., "new gesture detected, remember this")
- **Cell state $C_t$**: Long-term memory that persists across timesteps
- **Output gate $o_t$**: Decides what to expose as output

This gating mechanism allows LSTMs to learn which information is relevant for prediction and ignore noise.

### Loss Function: Categorical Cross-Entropy

For multiclass classification, we minimize the cross-entropy loss:

$$
\mathcal{L} = -\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\sum_{c=1}^{C} y_{i,c} \log(\hat{y}_{i,c})
$$

Where:
- $N$ is the number of training samples
- $C$ is the number of classes (8)
- $y_{i,c} \in \{0,1\}$ is the one-hot encoded true label (1 for correct class, 0 otherwise)
- $\hat{y}_{i,c} \in [0,1]$ is the predicted probability for class $c$ (from softmax)

**Softmax Output Layer:**

The final layer converts raw network outputs ("logits") to probabilities:

$$
\hat{y}_{i,c} = \frac{e^{z_c}}{\sum_{k=1}^{C} e^{z_k}}
$$

Where $z_c$ is the raw output for class $c$. Softmax ensures $\sum_c \hat{y}_{i,c} = 1$ (valid probability distribution).

### Optimization: Adam Algorithm

We train the network using the **Adam optimizer** (Adaptive Moment Estimation):

$$
\begin{aligned}
m_t &= \beta_1 m_{t-1} + (1 - \beta_1) g_t && \text{(First moment: mean of gradients)} \\
v_t &= \beta_2 v_{t-1} + (1 - \beta_2) g_t^2 && \text{(Second moment: variance of gradients)} \\
\hat{m}_t &= m_t / (1 - \beta_1^t) && \text{(Bias correction)} \\
\hat{v}_t &= v_t / (1 - \beta_2^t) && \text{(Bias correction)} \\
\theta_t &= \theta_{t-1} - \alpha \frac{\hat{m}_t}{\sqrt{\hat{v}_t} + \epsilon} && \text{(Parameter update)}
\end{aligned}
$$

Where:
- $g_t = \nabla_\theta \mathcal{L}$ is the gradient at step $t$
- $\alpha$ is the learning rate (typically 0.001)
- $\beta_1 = 0.9, \beta_2 = 0.999$ (standard hyperparameters)
- $\epsilon = 10^{-8}$ (numerical stability constant)

**Why Adam?**

Adam adapts the learning rate per-parameter based on gradient history. Parameters with noisy gradients get smaller updates (high $v_t$), while parameters with consistent gradients get larger updates. This accelerates convergence compared to vanilla SGD.
