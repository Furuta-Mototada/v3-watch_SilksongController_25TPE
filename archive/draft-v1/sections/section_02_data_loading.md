# Section 2: Converting and Loading Data into Python

## From UDP Packets to NumPy Arrays: The Mundane Reality of Data Ingestion

The tech press loves to talk about "AI models" and "deep learning breakthroughs," but conveniently glosses over the fact that most of machine learning is actually **data plumbing**. Before any model can learn anything, you need to convert real-world sensor readings into the specific data structures that Python's scientific computing stack expects. This section documents that unglamorous but absolutely critical process.

## Code Architecture: Three-Stage Ingestion Pipeline

### Stage 1: UDP Packet Reception (Network Layer)

The Android watch streams JSON-encoded sensor data over UDP. The Python receiver must:
1. Bind to a socket on the local network
2. Parse incoming JSON strings into Python dictionaries
3. Handle network errors (dropped packets, malformed JSON)

**Core Implementation** (`udp_listener_dashboard.py`, lines 200-250):

```python
import socket
import json
from collections import deque

def setup_udp_receiver(listen_ip="0.0.0.0", listen_port=54321):
    """
    Creates non-blocking UDP socket for sensor data reception.
    
    Args:
        listen_ip: IP address to bind (0.0.0.0 = all interfaces)
        listen_port: UDP port number
        
    Returns:
        Configured socket object
    """
    sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
    sock.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)
    sock.bind((listen_ip, listen_port))
    sock.setblocking(False)  # Non-blocking for async operation
    return sock
```

**Why Non-Blocking I/O?**

Network I/O is inherently unpredictable. Packets arrive at irregular intervals due to:
- Operating system scheduling jitter (~1-10ms variations)
- WiFi contention and retry mechanisms
- Application-layer buffering in the Android networking stack

Blocking I/O would cause the main thread to freeze whenever packets are delayed, creating stuttering in the ML pipeline. Non-blocking sockets allow the event loop to poll for data without halting other processing:

```python
async def receive_sensor_data(sock, buffer_queue):
    """
    Async coroutine that continuously polls UDP socket.
    
    Packets are parsed and appended to thread-safe deque.
    """
    while True:
        try:
            # Receive up to 1024 bytes (UDP packet size limit: 65,535 bytes)
            data, addr = sock.recvfrom(1024)
            packet = json.loads(data.decode('utf-8'))
            
            # Validate packet structure
            if 'sensor' in packet and 'timestamp' in packet:
                buffer_queue.append(packet)
                
        except BlockingIOError:
            # No data available, yield control to event loop
            await asyncio.sleep(0.001)  # 1ms poll interval
        except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
            # Corrupted packet, log and continue
            print(f"Malformed JSON: {e}")
            continue
```

**JSON Packet Structure:**

Each UDP packet contains a single sensor reading:

```json
{
  "sensor": "linear_acceleration",
  "accel_x": 0.234,
  "accel_y": -1.456,
  "accel_z": 9.812,
  "timestamp": 1729347123456
}
```

Alternative sensors have different field names:
- `gyroscope`: `gyro_x`, `gyro_y`, `gyro_z`
- `rotation_vector`: `rot_x`, `rot_y`, `rot_z`, `rot_w` (quaternion)
- `step_detector`: `step_count` (integer)

### Stage 2: Temporal Alignment and Buffering

Raw packets arrive out-of-order and at inconsistent intervals. Before feature extraction, we need to:
1. Merge data from multiple sensors by timestamp
2. Maintain fixed-size sliding windows for ML inference
3. Handle missing data (sensor dropout)

**Implementation** (`udp_listener_dashboard.py`, Collector Thread):

```python
from collections import deque
import pandas as pd

# Fixed-size buffers for each sensor type (0.3 second windows at 50Hz)
WINDOW_SIZE = int(0.3 * 50)  # 15 samples

class SensorBuffers:
    """Manages synchronized sensor data windows."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.accel_buffer = deque(maxlen=WINDOW_SIZE)
        self.gyro_buffer = deque(maxlen=WINDOW_SIZE)
        self.rotation_buffer = deque(maxlen=WINDOW_SIZE)
        
    def append(self, packet):
        """Routes packet to appropriate buffer based on sensor type."""
        sensor_type = packet['sensor']
        
        if sensor_type == 'linear_acceleration':
            self.accel_buffer.append({
                'timestamp': packet['timestamp'],
                'accel_x': packet.get('accel_x', 0.0),
                'accel_y': packet.get('accel_y', 0.0),
                'accel_z': packet.get('accel_z', 0.0)
            })
            
        elif sensor_type == 'gyroscope':
            self.gyro_buffer.append({
                'timestamp': packet['timestamp'],
                'gyro_x': packet.get('gyro_x', 0.0),
                'gyro_y': packet.get('gyro_y', 0.0),
                'gyro_z': packet.get('gyro_z', 0.0)
            })
            
        elif sensor_type == 'rotation_vector':
            self.rotation_buffer.append({
                'timestamp': packet['timestamp'],
                'rot_x': packet.get('rot_x', 0.0),
                'rot_y': packet.get('rot_y', 0.0),
                'rot_z': packet.get('rot_z', 0.0),
                'rot_w': packet.get('rot_w', 1.0)  # Default to identity quaternion
            })
    
    def to_dataframe(self):
        """
        Converts buffers to synchronized pandas DataFrame.
        
        Merges sensor streams by nearest timestamp (within 20ms tolerance).
        """
        # Convert deques to DataFrames
        df_accel = pd.DataFrame(list(self.accel_buffer))
        df_gyro = pd.DataFrame(list(self.gyro_buffer))
        df_rot = pd.DataFrame(list(self.rotation_buffer))
        
        # Merge on timestamp with nearest-neighbor join
        if len(df_accel) > 0:
            df = df_accel.copy()
            
            if len(df_gyro) > 0:
                df = pd.merge_asof(
                    df.sort_values('timestamp'),
                    df_gyro.sort_values('timestamp'),
                    on='timestamp',
                    direction='nearest',
                    tolerance=20  # 20ms tolerance
                )
            
            if len(df_rot) > 0:
                df = pd.merge_asof(
                    df,
                    df_rot.sort_values('timestamp'),
                    on='timestamp',
                    direction='nearest',
                    tolerance=20
                )
            
            return df.fillna(0)  # Fill missing values with zeros
        
        return pd.DataFrame()  # Empty DataFrame if no data
```

**Why `deque` with `maxlen`?**

Python's `collections.deque` with a fixed `maxlen` parameter automatically evicts old elements when new ones are appended. This creates a "sliding window" data structure that:
- Maintains O(1) append/pop operations (constant time, unlike lists which are O(n) for pop-left)
- Automatically limits memory usage (no need to manually trim)
- Provides FIFO (first-in-first-out) semantics perfect for time-series data

This is a textbook example of choosing the right data structure for the problemâ€”something that matters far more than choice of ML model in production systems.

### Stage 3: Conversion to NumPy Arrays for ML Inference

Once synchronized into a DataFrame, the data must be converted to NumPy arrays matching the expected input shape of the trained models.

**Feature Extraction Pipeline:**

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import skew, kurtosis
from scipy.fft import rfft

def extract_features_from_dataframe(df):
    """
    Extracts ~60 statistical features from sensor DataFrame.
    
    Args:
        df: DataFrame with columns [accel_x, accel_y, accel_z, gyro_x, gyro_y, gyro_z]
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary of feature_name: value pairs
    """
    features = {}
    
    # Time-domain features for each axis
    for axis in ['accel_x', 'accel_y', 'accel_z', 'gyro_x', 'gyro_y', 'gyro_z']:
        signal = df[axis].dropna()
        
        if len(signal) > 0:
            # Basic statistics
            features[f'{axis}_mean'] = signal.mean()
            features[f'{axis}_std'] = signal.std()
            features[f'{axis}_min'] = signal.min()
            features[f'{axis}_max'] = signal.max()
            features[f'{axis}_range'] = signal.max() - signal.min()
            features[f'{axis}_median'] = signal.median()
            
            # Higher-order moments
            features[f'{axis}_skew'] = skew(signal)
            features[f'{axis}_kurtosis'] = kurtosis(signal)
            
            # Frequency-domain features (FFT)
            if len(signal) > 2:
                fft_vals = np.abs(rfft(signal.to_numpy()))[:len(signal)//2]
                if len(fft_vals) > 0:
                    features[f'{axis}_fft_max'] = fft_vals.max()
                    features[f'{axis}_fft_mean'] = fft_vals.mean()
    
    # Cross-sensor magnitude features
    if all(col in df.columns for col in ['accel_x', 'accel_y', 'accel_z']):
        accel_mag = np.sqrt(df['accel_x']**2 + df['accel_y']**2 + df['accel_z']**2)
        features['accel_magnitude_mean'] = accel_mag.mean()
        features['accel_magnitude_std'] = accel_mag.std()
    
    if all(col in df.columns for col in ['gyro_x', 'gyro_y', 'gyro_z']):
        gyro_mag = np.sqrt(df['gyro_x']**2 + df['gyro_y']**2 + df['gyro_z']**2)
        features['gyro_magnitude_mean'] = gyro_mag.mean()
        features['gyro_magnitude_std'] = gyro_mag.std()
    
    return features
```

**Feature Vector Assembly:**

The final step converts the feature dictionary to a 2D NumPy array matching the model's expected input:

```python
import joblib

# Load saved feature names from training (ensures correct order)
feature_names = joblib.load('models/feature_names_binary.pkl')

def prepare_model_input(feature_dict, feature_names):
    """
    Converts feature dictionary to model-compatible NumPy array.
    
    Args:
        feature_dict: Dictionary from extract_features_from_dataframe()
        feature_names: List of feature names in training order
        
    Returns:
        2D NumPy array of shape (1, n_features)
    """
    # Extract features in the exact order used during training
    feature_vector = [feature_dict.get(name, 0.0) for name in feature_names]
    
    # Convert to 2D array (models expect batch dimension)
    return np.array([feature_vector])
```

**Critical Detail: Feature Ordering**

Machine learning models are brittleâ€”they expect features in **exactly** the same order they were trained on. Scramble the order, and predictions become garbage. This is why we:

1. Save `feature_names.pkl` during training
2. Load it during inference
3. Use it to explicitly order the feature vector

This is the kind of subtle bug that can waste days of debugging time if you don't get it right upfront.

## Complete End-to-End Data Flow

Putting it all together, here's the full pipeline from UDP packet to ML-ready array:

```python
# 1. Receive UDP packets
sock = setup_udp_receiver(listen_ip="0.0.0.0", listen_port=54321)
buffers = SensorBuffers()

# 2. Accumulate sensor data
while True:
    data, addr = sock.recvfrom(1024)
    packet = json.loads(data.decode('utf-8'))
    buffers.append(packet)
    
    # 3. When buffer is full, extract features
    if len(buffers.accel_buffer) >= WINDOW_SIZE:
        df = buffers.to_dataframe()
        features = extract_features_from_dataframe(df)
        
        # 4. Prepare model input
        X = prepare_model_input(features, feature_names)
        
        # 5. Make prediction (covered in Section 7)
        prediction = model.predict(X)
```

## Why This Matters More Than You Think

This code is not glamorous. It's not publishable. It won't get you citations or conference presentations. But **it's the code that actually matters in production systems**.

I've seen brilliant ML researchers with PhDs struggle to deploy their models because they never learned how to handle network I/O, parse JSON, or deal with missing data. They can derive backpropagation from first principles but don't know what `socket.setblocking(False)` does.

The reality of applied machine learning is that data ingestion, cleaning, and preprocessing typically consume 70-80% of development time. The actual model training is often the easiest partâ€”it's everything before and after that's hard.

This section documents that reality honestly.
