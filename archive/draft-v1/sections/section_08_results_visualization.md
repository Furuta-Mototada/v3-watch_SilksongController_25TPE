# Section 8: Visualize Results and Discuss Conclusions

## What Actually Worked (And What Didn't)

Machine learning papers are full of cherry-picked success stories. Let me be honest about what I learned from this project—both the successes and the systematic failures.

## Key Visualization 1: Model Comparison Across Tasks

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Prepare data
models = ['SVM\n(Binary)', 'CNN-LSTM\n(Binary)', 'SVM\n(Multiclass)', 'CNN-LSTM\n(Multiclass)']
accuracies = [0.824, 0.871, 0.732, 0.893]
f1_scores = [0.82, 0.87, 0.73, 0.87]
latencies = [8.3, 27.4, 8.3, 27.4]  # ms

fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 3, figsize=(15, 4))

# Accuracy comparison
axes[0].bar(models, accuracies, color=['#3498db', '#e74c3c', '#3498db', '#e74c3c'])
axes[0].set_ylabel('Accuracy')
axes[0].set_title('Test Set Accuracy')
axes[0].set_ylim([0, 1])
axes[0].axhline(y=0.8, color='gray', linestyle='--', alpha=0.5, label='Target (80%)')
axes[0].legend()

# F1 score comparison
axes[1].bar(models, f1_scores, color=['#3498db', '#e74c3c', '#3498db', '#e74c3c'])
axes[1].set_ylabel('Macro F1-Score')
axes[1].set_title('Macro-Averaged F1')
axes[1].set_ylim([0, 1])

# Latency comparison
axes[2].bar(models, latencies, color=['#3498db', '#e74c3c', '#3498db', '#e74c3c'])
axes[2].set_ylabel('Inference Time (ms)')
axes[2].set_title('Real-Time Latency')
axes[2].axhline(y=200, color='red', linestyle='--', alpha=0.5, label='Max Acceptable (200ms)')
axes[2].legend()

plt.tight_layout()
plt.savefig('model_comparison.png', dpi=150)
```

**Findings:**

1. **CNN-LSTM dominates on accuracy** (+16% for multiclass, +5% for binary)
2. **SVM is 3× faster** (8.3ms vs 27.4ms latency)
3. **Both meet real-time requirements** (<200ms)
4. **Binary classification easier** than multiclass (expected—fewer classes)

**Conclusion**: For deployment, I used CNN-LSTM despite higher latency because accuracy matters more than speed (both are fast enough).

## Key Visualization 2: Per-Class Performance Breakdown

```python
import pandas as pd

# Extract per-class metrics
classes = ['jump', 'punch', 'turn_left', 'turn_right', 'dash', 'block', 'walk', 'idle']
svm_f1 = [0.71, 0.69, 0.75, 0.75, 0.60, 0.56, 0.87, 0.90]
cnn_f1 = [0.89, 0.84, 0.90, 0.90, 0.76, 0.73, 0.95, 0.96]
sample_counts = [52, 47, 61, 58, 19, 17, 103, 143]

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(12, 6))

x = np.arange(len(classes))
width = 0.35

bars1 = ax.bar(x - width/2, svm_f1, width, label='SVM', color='#3498db')
bars2 = ax.bar(x + width/2, cnn_f1, width, label='CNN-LSTM', color='#e74c3c')

# Add sample counts as text labels
for i, count in enumerate(sample_counts):
    ax.text(i, max(svm_f1[i], cnn_f1[i]) + 0.05, f'n={count}', 
            ha='center', fontsize=9, color='gray')

ax.set_xlabel('Gesture Class')
ax.set_ylabel('F1-Score')
ax.set_title('Per-Class F1-Score Comparison (Test Set)')
ax.set_xticks(x)
ax.set_xticklabels(classes, rotation=45, ha='right')
ax.legend()
ax.set_ylim([0, 1.1])
ax.axhline(y=0.7, color='gray', linestyle='--', alpha=0.3, label='Acceptable (0.7)')
ax.grid(axis='y', alpha=0.3)

plt.tight_layout()
plt.savefig('per_class_performance.png', dpi=150)
```

**Findings:**

1. **CNN-LSTM improves every class** (no trade-offs)
2. **Rare gestures (dash, block) hardest** (n<20 samples insufficient)
3. **Common gestures (walk, idle) near-perfect** (>95% F1)
4. **Largest improvements**: Dash (+16%), block (+17%), jump (+18%)

**Interpretation**: Deep learning's advantage emerges on complex, rare gestures where hand-crafted features underperform. For simple, frequent gestures (walk/idle), even SVM achieves 87%+ F1.

## Key Visualization 3: Confusion Matrix Heatmap (CNN-LSTM)

(Already shown in Section 7, but worth reiterating key insights)

**Systematic Confusions:**

1. **Jump ↔ Punch (6% mutual)**:
   - Both involve rapid arm acceleration
   - Differ primarily in vertical vs. forward direction
   - Solution: Add rotation vector features (quaternion orientation)

2. **Dash → Walk (15%)**:
   - Dash is kinematically similar to fast walking
   - Only differs in speed/magnitude
   - Solution: Add velocity magnitude threshold

3. **Block → Idle (12%)**:
   - Block involves minimal movement (defensive posture)
   - Hard to distinguish from rest state
   - Solution: May require EMG (muscle activation) rather than IMU

## Discussion: What I Learned

### Success #1: Voice-Labeling Methodology

The WhisperX + word-level timestamp approach **worked brilliantly**. I collected 5,000 labeled samples in ~10 hours of data collection—far faster than manual annotation (which would have taken weeks).

**Impact**: This technique is generalizable to any gesture recognition project. I plan to publish it as a short paper.

### Success #2: Two-Tier Classification Architecture

Separating binary (locomotion) from multiclass (actions) **solved the gesture transition problem**. Without this, the model was constantly confused during walk → jump → walk sequences.

**Impact**: Real-time controller is now responsive and accurate. Gameplay feels natural.

### Success #3: CNN-LSTM Outperforms SVM

The 16% accuracy improvement from deep learning **justifies the added complexity**. For this application, where misclassifications ruin gameplay, every percentage point matters.

**Impact**: Final deployed model is CNN-LSTM (not SVM prototype).

---

### Failure #1: Dash and Block Gestures Underfitted

With only ~20 test samples each, these classes never achieved >76% F1.

**Root cause**: Insufficient training data (collected only 100 samples total for each).

**Lesson**: Class balance matters. I should have collected 500+ samples per gesture (not just 300-400 for common gestures and 100 for rare ones).

**Fix**: Ongoing data collection sessions to reach 500+ samples per class.

### Failure #2: Real-World Accuracy < Test Set Accuracy

Test set: 89.3% accuracy. Real-world gameplay: 87.5% accuracy.

**Root cause**: Test set was collected under controlled conditions (seated, isolated gestures). Real gameplay involves:
- Simultaneous gestures (walking while punching)
- Fatigue (motion changes after 20 minutes of continuous play)
- Environmental distractions (sudden noises, visual attention shifts)

**Lesson**: Lab conditions ≠ deployment conditions. Always validate on naturalistic data.

**Fix**: Collected "fatigue session" and "dual-task session" data to retrain model on realistic scenarios.

### Failure #3: Model Size Too Large for ESP32 Deployment

CNN-LSTM model: 1.2 MB. ESP32 flash: 4 MB total (but only ~1 MB available after firmware).

**Root cause**: Didn't design for embedded deployment constraints.

**Lesson**: Model compression is critical for edge deployment. Should have used TensorFlow Lite quantization from the start.

**Fix**: Applied post-training quantization (INT8), reduced model to 320 KB with <2% accuracy loss.

## Comparison to Related Work

How does this project compare to published gesture recognition systems?

| System | Accuracy | Latency | Classes | Deployment |
|--------|----------|---------|---------|-----------|
| **This Project (CNN-LSTM)** | **89%** | **27ms** | **8** | **Real-time game control** |
| Myo Armband (EMG, 2016) | 92% | 50ms | 6 | Laboratory only |
| Google Pixel Watch (2023) | 85% | 40ms | 4 | Fitness tracking |
| Apple Watch (Core ML, 2022) | 88% | 35ms | 5 | Gesture shortcuts |
| Academic: Wang et al. (2019) | 91% | 15ms | 10 | Not deployed |

**Analysis:**

1. **My accuracy (89%) is competitive** with commercial systems
2. **Latency (27ms) is state-of-the-art** (faster than Myo, Pixel Watch)
3. **8 gesture classes** exceeds most consumer devices (4-6 typical)
4. **Actually deployed and playable** (not just lab prototype)

**Limitation**: Single-subject evaluation (n=1). Commercial systems train on 100+ users. My model is personalized but not generalizable.

## Future Work: Where This Goes Next

### Improvement 1: Multi-User Training
Collect data from 10+ users to build a general-purpose model that works for anyone (not just me).

### Improvement 2: Transfer Learning
Use pre-trained CNN features from ImageNet-style dataset of IMU gestures (if one exists) to reduce data requirements.

### Improvement 3: Real-Time Model Updating
Implement online learning where the model adapts to my motion patterns over time (addresses fatigue/variability).

### Improvement 4: Sensor Fusion
Add EMG sensors (muscle activation) to improve dash/block detection (where IMU alone is insufficient).
