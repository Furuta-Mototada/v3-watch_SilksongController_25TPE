## Real-Time Sensor Fusion for Gesture Recognition: A Century of Wearable Computing

### The Data Itself

This project uses **inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor data** captured from a Google Pixel Watch worn on my dominant wrist during natural gesture performance. The dataset represents real-time biosensor streams that encode the physics of human motion into computational signals.

**What's included:**

- **Linear acceleration** (3-axis): $\vec{a} = [a_x, a_y, a_z]$ in m/s²
- **Gyroscopic rotation** (3-axis): $\vec{\omega} = [\omega_x, \omega_y, \omega_z]$ in rad/s  
- **Rotation vectors** (4-axis quaternion): $\vec{q} = [q_x, q_y, q_z, q_w]$ (unit quaternion representation)
- **Step detection** (discrete events): Binary triggers for gait analysis
- **Sampling rate**: ~50 Hz sustained UDP packet transmission
- **Total gesture classes**: 8 distinct actions (walk, idle, jump, punch, turn_left, turn_right, dash, block)

### Why This Data Matters (And Why The Hype is Wrong)

If you've been following the tech media lately, you'd think gesture recognition on wearables is some kind of revolutionary breakthrough. Articles breathlessly describe how "AI-powered smartwatches can now understand your movements" as if we've achieved some kind of technological singularity. Let me be clear: **we've been doing gesture recognition with wearable accelerometers since the 1990s.**

The first accelerometer-based gesture recognition systems appeared in academic labs around 1997 (see Paradiso et al., "Interactive Dance and Resistance Training" at MIT Media Lab). Nintendo shipped the Wii Remote with 3-axis accelerometer-based motion controls in 2006—nearly two decades ago. The Xbox Kinect, which solved a far harder problem (full-body skeletal tracking from RGB-D cameras), launched in 2010 and remains one of the fastest-selling consumer electronics devices in history.

So what's actually new here? Almost nothing about the fundamental technology. What *has* changed is:

1. **Miniaturization**: Modern MEMS sensors fit in watch-sized form factors
2. **Wireless protocols**: Bluetooth Low Energy and WiFi enable untethered operation  
3. **Computational accessibility**: Pre-trained ML models and hardware acceleration make deployment trivial
4. **Integration**: Android Wear OS provides standardized sensor APIs

But the physics hasn't changed. The signal processing hasn't changed. The classification algorithms we're using (Support Vector Machines) were invented in 1963. Even the "deep learning" approaches (CNNs, LSTMs) date to the 1980s and 1990s.

This is not a critique—it's context. What makes this project interesting is not technological novelty, but **application specificity**: using commodity wearable sensors to solve a real interaction problem (controlling a video game hands-free during gameplay).

### How the Data Was Obtained

**Hardware Stack:**

The data originates from a Google Pixel Watch 2 running a custom Android Wear OS application I developed in Kotlin. The watch contains:

- **Bosch BMI260** 6-axis IMU (accelerometer + gyroscope)
- **Qualcomm Snapdragon W5+ Gen 1** processor (4nm, ARM Cortex-A53)
- Built-in step counter (pedometer) via Android's `SensorManager` API

**Software Pipeline:**

1. **Android Application** (`MainActivity.kt`):
   - Registers listeners for `TYPE_LINEAR_ACCELERATION`, `TYPE_GYROSCOPE`, `TYPE_ROTATION_VECTOR`, and `TYPE_STEP_DETECTOR`
   - Streams sensor events at maximum hardware rate (~50-100 Hz depending on sensor type)
   - Packages data into JSON payloads: `{"sensor": "...", "accel_x": ..., "timestamp": ...}`
   - Transmits via UDP packets to local network

2. **Network Discovery**:
   - Implements **Network Service Discovery (NSD)** using mDNS/DNS-SD (Apple's Bonjour protocol)
   - Service type: `_silksong._udp.` (custom service for this application)
   - Automatic IP/port discovery eliminates manual configuration

3. **Python Receiver** (`udp_listener_dashboard.py`):
   - Opens UDP socket on port 54321 (configurable)
   - Non-blocking async I/O using Python's `asyncio` event loop
   - Parses JSON packets and appends to thread-safe deques

**Data Collection Methodology:**

I collected training data using `continuous_data_collector.py`, which simultaneously:
- Records sensor streams to CSV: `timestamp,sensor,accel_x,accel_y,accel_z,gyro_x,gyro_y,gyro_z,rot_x,rot_y,rot_z,rot_w`
- Captures audio via microphone for voice labeling (16 kHz, mono)
- Saves metadata: session duration, sample count, gesture distribution

The voice-labeling workflow deserves explanation because it solves a fundamental problem in gesture recognition research: **obtaining accurate temporal labels for continuous motion data is extraordinarily difficult**. Traditional approaches require either:
1. Manual frame-by-frame annotation (prohibitively slow)
2. External video recording + post-hoc labeling (time-intensive, error-prone)
3. Button-press synchronization (breaks natural motion flow)

My solution: **speak the gesture name while performing it**. Post-processing with WhisperX (a word-level timestamp-aligned speech recognition model) automatically generates labels:

```
"jump" (spoken at t=2.3s) → label window [2.3s, 2.8s] as "jump" gesture
```

This achieves sub-second labeling accuracy while preserving naturalistic movement patterns—a technique I adapted from clinical gait analysis protocols but haven't seen widely adopted in HCI research.

### Dataset Characteristics

**Collected Data Structure:**

```
data/continuous/YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_session/
├── sensor_data.csv          # Raw IMU streams (50Hz)
├── audio_16k.wav            # Voice labels (16kHz)
├── metadata.json            # Session info
├── SESSION_whisperx.json    # Speech transcription
└── SESSION_labels.csv       # Aligned gesture labels
```

**Training Set Statistics (as of successful model):**

- **Total samples**: ~5,000 gesture windows
- **Window size**: 0.3 seconds (15 frames at 50Hz) for micro-predictions
- **Gesture distribution** (approximate from successful training):
  - Walk: ~1,200 samples (locomotion baseline)
  - Idle: ~1,500 samples (rest state)
  - Jump: ~400 samples (discrete action)
  - Punch: ~500 samples (discrete action)
  - Turn_left/Turn_right: ~600 samples each (directional)
  - Dash/Block: ~300 samples each (advanced actions)

**Data Quality Considerations:**

Unlike carefully controlled laboratory conditions, this data reflects **realistic usage**:

- **Environmental noise**: WiFi packet loss, sensor dropout, sudden accelerations from external perturbations
- **Subject variability**: I am the only subject (n=1), but I performed gestures at different speeds, amplitudes, and arm positions
- **Temporal resolution**: 50 Hz is on the lower end for high-frequency motion capture but sufficient for human-scale gestures (most human movements have dominant frequencies below 10 Hz)

**Why 50 Hz?**

The Nyquist theorem requires sampling at ≥2× the highest frequency component you want to capture. Human limb movements during gestures typically contain frequencies up to 15-20 Hz. 50 Hz sampling provides a safety margin while remaining transmissible over standard UDP without overwhelming network bandwidth:

$$
\text{Data rate} = 50 \text{ Hz} \times 10 \text{ sensors} \times 4 \text{ bytes/float} = 2 \text{ KB/s}
$$

Trivial by modern standards, but the historical constraint (early wearable systems had to work over 9600 baud serial connections) established conventions we still follow today.

### The Human Element: What This Data Actually Represents

These numbers—accelerometer readings, gyroscope angles, rotation quaternions—are not abstract mathematical entities. They are **traces of human intention encoded through biomechanics**.

When I punch:
1. My motor cortex fires a spatiotemporal pattern of neural signals
2. Descending pathways activate shoulder, elbow, and wrist muscles in sequence
3. Muscle contraction accelerates my arm forward (~5-8 m/s² typical for a casual punch)
4. The watch detects this acceleration, rotates to track wrist orientation, measures angular velocity
5. 20 milliseconds later, another sensor reading captures the next instant of motion

What makes gesture recognition work is not magical AI, but the **physical consistency of human motor control**. Our nervous systems are optimized to produce stereotyped movements—performing the same gesture twice produces similar kinematic signatures because our muscles, tendons, and neural circuits are mechanical systems with consistent dynamics.

The real challenge isn't recognizing gestures in isolation (trivial with sufficient data). The real challenge is **handling the transition regions** between gestures, the variability introduced by fatigue, the subtle differences between "punch" and "reach forward," the ambiguity when motion is too fast to sample accurately.

This is why the confusion matrix matters. This is why real-world deployment is hard. This is why every gesture recognition paper shows pristine results on their lab-collected dataset but struggles when users try it.

### Why This Dataset Exists

I collected this data because I wanted to play *Hollow Knight: Silksong* (when it eventually releases) using motion controls while cycling on a stationary bike. This is a real problem: I exercise while gaming, but holding a controller interferes with maintaining proper cycling posture and grip.

Voice control won't work (too slow, requires quiet environment). Computer vision won't work (camera can't always see my hands, tracking is fragile). EMG armbands are too expensive and uncomfortable for extended use.

Wrist-worn IMUs are the Goldilocks solution: unobtrusive, already on my body (I wear the watch anyway), computationally tractable, and mechanically coupled to the gestures I want to detect.

The data exists because the commercial solutions are inadequate. Off-the-shelf gesture recognition SDKs are trained for generic "tap," "rotate," and "shake" gestures—useless for game controls that require discrete actions like "jump" and "attack."

So I collected my own dataset. This is what personal computing actually means: adapting technology to solve problems that matter to you, even if you're the only person in the world with that exact problem.

**Next sections will detail how I transformed these raw sensor streams into classified gestures.**
