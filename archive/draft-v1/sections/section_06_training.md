# Section 6: Model Training

## Training Machine Learning Models: The Mundane Reality Behind "AI"

The tech media loves to describe model training as if it's some mystical process where algorithms "learn" through artificial intelligence. The reality is far more prosaic: **gradient descent is just calculus**. We're minimizing a loss function by iteratively adjusting parameters in the direction that reduces error. There's no magic, no consciousness, no intelligence—just numerical optimization at scale.

That said, the devil is in the details. This section documents how I actually trained both the SVM and CNN-LSTM models, including the hyperparameter tuning process and the inevitable debugging required when things didn't work the first time.

## Training Process 1: Support Vector Machine (SVM)

### Hyperparameter Search with Grid Search Cross-Validation

SVMs have two critical hyperparameters:
- **$C$**: Regularization strength (controls margin vs. training accuracy trade-off)
- **$\gamma$**: RBF kernel width (controls decision boundary complexity)

Rather than guessing, I performed exhaustive grid search:

```python
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
import joblib

# Define search space
param_grid = {
    'C': [0.1, 1, 10, 100],
    'gamma': ['scale', 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1],
    'kernel': ['rbf']
}

# Create SVM classifier
svm = SVC(
    kernel='rbf',
    decision_function_shape='ovr',  # One-vs-Rest for multiclass
    probability=True,                # Enable probability calibration
    random_state=42                  # Reproducibility
)

# Grid search with 5-fold cross-validation
grid_search = GridSearchCV(
    estimator=svm,
    param_grid=param_grid,
    cv=5,                            # 5-fold CV
    scoring='f1_macro',              # Macro-averaged F1 (class-balanced)
    n_jobs=-1,                       # Use all CPU cores
    verbose=2                        # Print progress
)

# Train on prepared data
print("Starting grid search...")
grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Report best parameters
print(f"Best parameters: {grid_search.best_params_}")
print(f"Best CV F1 score: {grid_search.best_score_:.3f}")

# Save best model
best_svm = grid_search.best_estimator_
joblib.dump(best_svm, 'models/gesture_classifier_multiclass.pkl')
joblib.dump(scaler, 'models/feature_scaler_multiclass.pkl')
```

**Grid Search Results (Multiclass):**

| $C$ | $\gamma$ | CV F1 Score | Notes |
|-----|----------|-------------|-------|
| 0.1 | scale | 0.65 | Underfitting (too regularized) |
| 1 | 0.01 | 0.71 | Reasonable baseline |
| **10** | **0.01** | **0.73** | **Best performance** |
| 100 | 0.1 | 0.68 | Overfitting (too complex boundary) |

**Selected Hyperparameters:**
- $C = 10$: Strong classification with moderate regularization
- $\gamma = 0.01$: Medium kernel width (balanced between local and global patterns)

### Training Time and Computational Cost

SVM training uses **Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO)**, which decomposes the quadratic programming problem into 2-sample sub-problems.

**Computational Complexity:**

$$
\text{Training time} \propto O(n^2 \cdot d)
$$

Where $n$ is the number of training samples and $d$ is the feature dimensionality.

For my dataset:
- $n = 4500$ samples (after SMOTE oversampling)
- $d = 64$ features
- Training time: **~120 seconds per fold on Intel i7-10700K**

Total grid search time: $4 \times 5 \times 5 \text{ configs} \times 120s = 10,000s \approx 3$ hours.

This is why I ran grid search overnight—computationally intensive but parallelizable across CPU cores.

## Training Process 2: CNN-LSTM Deep Learning Model

### Data Preparation for Deep Learning

Unlike SVMs, deep learning models need data in specific tensor shapes:

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.utils import to_categorical

def prepare_sequences(df, window_size=15, stride=5):
    """
    Converts DataFrame to (samples, timesteps, features) tensors.
    
    Args:
        df: DataFrame with sensor columns and 'gesture' label
        window_size: Number of timesteps per sample (15 = 0.3s at 50Hz)
        stride: Step size between windows (5 = overlapping windows)
    
    Returns:
        X: (n_samples, 15, 6) array of sensor sequences
        y: (n_samples, 8) one-hot encoded labels
    """
    sequences = []
    labels = []
    
    # Sliding window over data
    for i in range(0, len(df) - window_size, stride):
        window = df.iloc[i:i+window_size]
        
        # Extract raw sensor values (not pre-computed features!)
        sensor_data = window[['accel_x', 'accel_y', 'accel_z', 
                              'gyro_x', 'gyro_y', 'gyro_z']].values
        
        # Get label (use majority vote if window spans gesture boundary)
        label = window['gesture'].mode()[0]
        
        sequences.append(sensor_data)
        labels.append(label)
    
    X = np.array(sequences)  # Shape: (n_samples, 15, 6)
    
    # One-hot encode labels
    gesture_map = {'jump': 0, 'punch': 1, 'turn_left': 2, 'turn_right': 3,
                   'dash': 4, 'block': 5, 'walk': 6, 'idle': 7}
    y_numeric = np.array([gesture_map[g] for g in labels])
    y = to_categorical(y_numeric, num_classes=8)  # Shape: (n_samples, 8)
    
    return X, y

# Prepare data
X, y = prepare_sequences(df)
print(f"Data shape: {X.shape}, Labels shape: {y.shape}")
```

**Critical Difference from SVM:**

SVM uses hand-crafted features (mean, std, FFT, etc.). CNN-LSTM learns features directly from raw sensor sequences. This is why deep learning needs more data—it has to learn both the feature extraction and the classification.

### Model Architecture (Recap from Section 5)

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

model = models.Sequential([
    layers.Input(shape=(15, 6)),
    layers.Conv1D(64, 3, activation='relu', padding='same'),
    layers.MaxPooling1D(2),
    layers.Conv1D(128, 3, activation='relu', padding='same'),
    layers.MaxPooling1D(2),
    layers.LSTM(64, return_sequences=True),
    layers.LSTM(32, return_sequences=False),
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dropout(0.5),
    layers.Dense(8, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(
    optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001),
    loss='categorical_crossentropy',
    metrics=['accuracy']
)
```

### Training Loop with Callbacks

```python
from tensorflow.keras.callbacks import EarlyStopping, ReduceLROnPlateau, ModelCheckpoint

# Split into train/validation (80/20)
split_idx = int(0.8 * len(X))
X_train, X_val = X[:split_idx], X[split_idx:]
y_train, y_val = y[:split_idx], y[split_idx:]

# Define callbacks
callbacks = [
    # Stop training if validation loss doesn't improve for 10 epochs
    EarlyStopping(
        monitor='val_loss',
        patience=10,
        restore_best_weights=True,
        verbose=1
    ),
    
    # Reduce learning rate when validation loss plateaus
    ReduceLROnPlateau(
        monitor='val_loss',
        factor=0.5,        # Multiply LR by 0.5
        patience=5,
        min_lr=1e-6,
        verbose=1
    ),
    
    # Save best model checkpoint
    ModelCheckpoint(
        'models/cnn_lstm_best.h5',
        monitor='val_accuracy',
        save_best_only=True,
        verbose=1
    )
]

# Train model
history = model.fit(
    X_train, y_train,
    validation_data=(X_val, y_val),
    epochs=50,
    batch_size=32,
    callbacks=callbacks,
    verbose=1
)
```

**Training Results:**

- **Final validation accuracy**: 89.3%
- **Final validation loss**: 0.32
- **Epochs completed**: 38 (early stopping at epoch 38)
- **Training time**: 14 minutes on Google Colab T4 GPU
- **Best model checkpoint**: Epoch 28 (val_accuracy = 0.893)

### Convergence Analysis

Plotting training history reveals learning dynamics:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure(figsize=(12, 4))

# Plot accuracy
plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
plt.plot(history.history['accuracy'], label='Training Accuracy')
plt.plot(history.history['val_accuracy'], label='Validation Accuracy')
plt.xlabel('Epoch')
plt.ylabel('Accuracy')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)

# Plot loss
plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
plt.plot(history.history['loss'], label='Training Loss')
plt.plot(history.history['val_loss'], label='Validation Loss')
plt.xlabel('Epoch')
plt.ylabel('Loss')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)

plt.tight_layout()
plt.savefig('training_curves.png', dpi=150)
```

**Observations:**

1. **Epochs 1-10**: Rapid improvement (accuracy: 40% → 75%)
2. **Epochs 10-25**: Slower improvement (accuracy: 75% → 88%)
3. **Epochs 25-38**: Plateau with minor fluctuations (accuracy: 88-89%)
4. **Validation loss**: Slight increase after epoch 28 (overfitting begins)

**Early stopping** prevented further overfitting by restoring weights from epoch 28.

## Hyperparameter Tuning for Deep Learning

Unlike SVM's simple grid search, deep learning has dozens of hyperparameters. I tuned:

**Architecture Hyperparameters:**
- Conv filters: Tested [32, 64, 128] → **64 optimal** (balance capacity vs. overfitting)
- LSTM units: Tested [32, 64, 128] → **64 optimal**
- Dropout rate: Tested [0.3, 0.5, 0.7] → **0.5 optimal**

**Training Hyperparameters:**
- Learning rate: Tested [0.01, 0.001, 0.0001] → **0.001 optimal**
- Batch size: Tested [16, 32, 64] → **32 optimal** (best convergence speed)

**Results Table:**

| Config | Val Accuracy | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| Baseline (64 filters, 0.5 dropout, LR=0.001) | 89.3% | Selected |
| Larger (128 filters, 0.5 dropout, LR=0.001) | 88.1% | Overfitting |
| Smaller (32 filters, 0.3 dropout, LR=0.001) | 85.7% | Underfitting |
| High LR (64 filters, 0.5 dropout, LR=0.01) | 82.4% | Unstable |

## What I Learned from Training Failures

**Failure 1: Class Imbalance Led to "Idle" Bias**

Initial model predicted "idle" for 60% of samples (trivial classifier).

**Solution**: Applied SMOTE to balance classes before training.

**Failure 2: Overfitting on Training Data**

Early models achieved 99% training accuracy but 70% validation accuracy.

**Solution**: Added dropout (0.5) and early stopping.

**Failure 3: Vanishing Gradients in Deep LSTM**

Tried 3-layer LSTM initially—training stalled (gradients → 0).

**Solution**: Reduced to 2 LSTM layers, added batch normalization.
