Of course. This is the final and most crucial step: a rigorous evaluation of your completed work against the specific demands of the assignment. You have the assignment brief and your finished Jupyter Notebook. Let's convene the roundtable to conduct a comprehensive review and ensure every requirement is fulfilled.

### **Roundtable: CS156 Final Project Review - "Can ML Tell Allison and Ingrid Apart?"**

**Moderator:** "Welcome, team. Today, we are reviewing a completed project for CS156, 'Pipeline - First Draft.' The student, Carl, has submitted a Jupyter Notebook in which he builds a machine learning pipeline to classify faces. Our task is to evaluate this submission against the 10-section rubric provided in the assignment brief to ensure all demands have been met. Professor Watson, as the instructor for this course, please lead the evaluation."

#### **Evaluation Against the CS156 Rubric**

**Prof. Watson (AI/ML Professor):** "Excellent. I have the student's notebook and the assignment brief in front of me. Let's proceed section by section."

**1. Explain the Data:**
*   **Requirement:** "The first section of the notebook should explain the data: what is included, how it was obtained, and all important details..."
*   **Analysis:** "The student's 'Problem Definition' section does this perfectly. It establishes a clear, personal motivation—people confusing him and Allison—which is exactly the kind of creative expression I look for. He clearly states the data consists of images of himself and Allison, sourced from his personal digital archive. He even mentions the 'images/both' folder and why it exists. This is an exemplary fulfillment of the requirement."
*   **Verdict:** **Demand Fulfilled.**

**2. Code for Converting and Loading Data:**
*   **Requirement:** "The second section... should contain well-commented code for converting this data to python readable format... and loading this data into an appropriate data structure..."
*   **Analysis (Data Scientist):** "Looking at the notebook, the Python code under 'Implementation' does precisely this. The `get_faces` function iterates through image folders (`os.walk`), uses OpenCV (`cv2.imread`) to convert JPG files into NumPy arrays, and processes them. The code is clean and includes comments explaining its purpose. This is a solid, standard approach."
*   **Verdict:** **Demand Fulfilled.**

**3. Cleaning, Pre-processing, and Feature Engineering:**
*   **Requirement:** "The third section... should include a markdown section explaining any necessary cleaning, pre-processing, and feature engineering... and a include a code block completing these steps."
*   **Analysis (Computer Vision Specialist):** "This is a strong point of the project. The student correctly identifies that the raw images contain noisy backgrounds. Their 'feature engineering' step is the use of a **pre-trained Haar cascade classifier to perform face detection.** This isolates the most important feature—the face—and discards irrelevant data. The markdown explicitly justifies this choice, even contrasting it with a CNN and explaining why Haar is a pragmatic choice for a small dataset. The code block within the `get_faces` function that calls `facecascade.detectMultiScale` and extracts the Region of Interest (ROI) is the direct implementation of this. It's a very intelligent approach."
*   **Verdict:** **Demand Fulfilled.**

**4. Analysis Discussion and Data Splits:**
*   **Requirement:** "The fourth section should include a markdown section discussing the analysis (classification...)... along with... code block performs any necessary data splits..."
*   **Analysis (Data Scientist):** "The student clearly states they will perform classification using KNN. The code then uses `train_test_split` from `scikit-learn` to create training and test sets. A very clever addition was to loop through multiple `random_state` values. This demonstrates an understanding of how different data splits can affect outcomes and is a good way to show model variance without implementing full cross-validation. It's a thoughtful touch."
*   **Verdict:** **Demand Fulfilled.**

**5. Model Selection and Mathematical Underpinnings:**
*   **Requirement:** "The fifth section should discuss model selection in a markdown section and include model initialization... This section should include a clear discussion of the model's mathematical underpinnings..."
*   **Analysis (Prof. Watson):** "Yes, the student does this well. They justify the choice of KNN by noting it's a simple model not covered in class that works well for small datasets. They then explain the core concept of KNN: classifying new points based on the 'k nearest labeled feature vectors.' They even cite a source (StatQuest by Josh Starmer), which is excellent academic practice and shows they went outside the course materials to understand the model. The code `model = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=3)` is the correct initialization."
*   **Verdict:** **Demand Fulfilled.**

**6. Model Training:**
*   **Requirement:** "The sixth section should train the model..."
*   **Analysis (Data Scientist):** "The line `model.fit(x_train, y_train)` is present and correct. This is the standard implementation for training a `scikit-learn` model."
*   **Verdict:** **Demand Fulfilled.**

**7. Generate Predictions and Compute Performance Metrics:**
*   **Requirement:** "The seventh section should contain code to generate predictions for out of sample data, and compute appropriate performance metrics."
*   **Analysis (Prof. Watson):** "The student uses `model.score` to get the accuracy and correctly implements `ConfusionMatrixDisplay.from_predictions` to compute and visualize a confusion matrix. These are the exact types of performance metrics I expect to see. Excellent."
*   **Verdict:** **Demand Fulfilled.**

**8. Visualize Results and Discuss Conclusions:**
*   **Requirement:** "The eighth section should visualize the results and discuss your conclusions."
*   **Analysis (Prof. Watson):** "This is, frankly, the best part of the entire report. The student visualizes nine different confusion matrices, showing the model's variable performance. They astutely observe the classification is 'meh at best.' But they don't stop there. They form a hypothesis: 'is this because Allison and I are hard to tell apart, or is it just because the dataset is so small that the model is not great?' They then design and run a brilliant control experiment: classifying Ingrid vs. Paul. The model achieves near-perfect scores on this task. This allows them to conclude, with evidence, that the pipeline itself is sound, and the original problem was genuinely difficult. This is A+ scientific reasoning and exactly what the 'ML Flexibility' learning outcome is about."
*   **Verdict:** **Demand Fulfilled.**

**9. Executive Summary:**
*   **Requirement:** "The ninth section should be an executive summary of the prior eight sections, clearly explaining your steps, diagramming your pipeline, visualizing any key results, and explaining any key insights or shortcomings..."
*   **Analysis (Prof. Watson):** "Looking through the notebook, I don't see a distinct section explicitly labeled 'Executive Summary.' The student's analysis is spread throughout, but the assignment requires a single, consolidated summary at the end. This is the **one missing component.** The student needs to add a final markdown cell that acts as a 'TL;DR' for the entire project, summarizing the problem, the pipeline (Haar -> KNN), the key result (the model struggles with Allison/Ingrid but excels with Ingrid/Paul), and the conclusion (the two are genuinely hard for a computer to tell apart with this model)."
*   **Verdict:** **Demand NOT Fulfilled (but easily fixable).**

**10. References:**
*   **Requirement:** "The tenth section should contain references for documents, guides, or code repos you accessed..."
*   **Analysis (Data Scientist):** "The student has included a 'References' section at the end, citing their sources for code, OpenCV documentation, and the StatQuest video on KNN. This is perfect."
*   **Verdict:** **Demand Fulfilled.**

### **Final Verdict and Summary**

**Moderator:** "Professor Watson, what is the final verdict?"

**Prof. Watson:** "The work is excellent. It's a creative, well-motivated project that demonstrates a strong grasp of the entire machine learning pipeline. The comparative analysis with the 'Ingrid vs. Paul' test is particularly insightful and shows a high level of critical thinking. The project successfully meets the learning outcomes for `cs156-MLCode`, `cs156-MLExplaination`, and especially `cs156-MLFlexibility`.

The submission fulfills 9 out of the 10 rubric requirements perfectly. The only missing piece is the consolidated Executive Summary."

### **Final Actionable To-Do List:**

1.  **Add an "Executive Summary" Section:** Create a new markdown cell at the end of your notebook (before the References). In this cell, write 2-3 paragraphs summarizing the entire project from start to finish. Include the simple pipeline diagram from the assignment brief if you can.
2.  **Final Polish:** Reread the entire notebook one last time to check for typos or clarity.
3.  **Export and Submit:** Export the final, complete notebook as a single PDF and submit it.

"This is a top-tier project. Just add that summary, and you'll have a submission to be proud of."
