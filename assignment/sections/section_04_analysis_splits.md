# Section 4: Analysis Discussion and Data Splits

## The Classification Task: Hierarchical Gesture Recognition

The media loves to talk about "AI that understands human movement" as if we've achieved some kind of semantic understanding. Let me be blunt: **we're pattern matching on feature vectors**. The model has no concept of what a "punch" *is*—it's just learned that feature vector $(x_1, x_2, ..., x_{64})$ maps to label $y=3$ with high probability based on training examples.

But that doesn't mean the problem is trivial. Gesture recognition has real challenges that go beyond simple classification.

## Problem Formulation: Multi-Task Binary and Multiclass Classification

This project implements a **two-tiered classification strategy**:

### Tier 1: Locomotion Classification (Binary)
$$
f_{\text{binary}}: \mathbb{R}^{64} \rightarrow \{0, 1\} = \{\text{idle}, \text{walk}\}
$$

**Purpose**: Determines the player's **base state**—are they stationary or moving?

**Why Binary First?**

In the game, locomotion and discrete actions are fundamentally different:
- **Locomotion is continuous**: Walking requires holding the left/right arrow key for duration
- **Actions are discrete**: Jump/punch are single key presses (press 'z', release immediately)

Separating these into different models prevents a critical problem: **gesture transition ambiguity**. Consider the sequence:

```
t=0.0s: Walking → t=0.3s: Still walking → t=0.6s: Jump while walking → t=0.9s: Walking again
```

If we use a single 8-class classifier, the window at t=0.6s contains motion from both "walk" and "jump," creating a confused hybrid signal. The two-tier approach handles this elegantly:

1. **Binary model** identifies sustained locomotion state (low-frequency, ~50ms latency acceptable)
2. **Multiclass model** detects action overlays (high-frequency, <200ms latency critical)

This mirrors how humans actually control games—locomotion is controlled by your left thumb (continuous), actions by your right thumb (discrete).

### Tier 2: Action Classification (Multiclass)
$$
f_{\text{multi}}: \mathbb{R}^{64} \rightarrow \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\} = \{\text{jump, punch, turn\_left, turn\_right, dash, block, walk, idle}\}
$$

**Purpose**: Detects **discrete action gestures** layered on top of the locomotion state.

**Gesture Inventory:**

| Class ID | Gesture | Physical Motion | Game Action |
|---------|---------|----------------|-------------|
| 0 | Jump | Sharp upward wrist flick | Character jumps (press 'z') |
| 1 | Punch | Forward thrust of forearm | Character attacks (press 'x') |
| 2 | Turn Left | Wrist rotation counterclockwise | Change facing left, walk left |
| 3 | Turn Right | Wrist rotation clockwise | Change facing right, walk right |
| 4 | Dash | Rapid forward jerk | Character dashes forward |
| 5 | Block | Arm pullback toward chest | Defensive stance |
| 6 | Walk | Periodic arm swing | (Handled by binary model) |
| 7 | Idle | Minimal movement | (Handled by binary model) |

**Design Rationale:**

The 8-class problem includes "walk" and "idle" for completeness, but the real-time controller primarily uses this model for action detection (classes 0-5). This redundancy provides a **fallback mechanism** if the binary model fails.

## Data Splits: Train/Validation/Test Partitioning

Machine learning 101: **never test on training data**. But the devil is in the details of how you split.

### Strategy 1: Chronological Split (Initial Approach)

Early in development, I naively split data chronologically:

```python
# Train on first 70% of data, test on last 30%
split_idx = int(0.7 * len(data))
train_data = data[:split_idx]
test_data = data[split_idx:]
```

**Result**: Artificially inflated accuracy (~95%) due to **temporal correlation**.

**Why This Failed:**

Sensor data within a session has **autocorrelation**—each sample is similar to the previous one. If I perform "jump" at timestamp T, the samples at T+0.1s and T+0.2s are almost identical. Chronological splits leak this correlation:

$$
\text{Corr}(x_t, x_{t+\Delta t}) \approx e^{-\lambda \Delta t} \quad \text{for small } \Delta t
$$

The test set becomes trivially predictable from the training set's tail, which doesn't reflect real deployment (where gestures arrive in arbitrary order).

### Strategy 2: Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation (Current Approach)

The correct method for time-series gesture data is **stratified GroupKFold**:

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import GroupKFold
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score

# Define groups: each recording session is one group
# This prevents samples from the same gesture instance appearing in both train and test
groups = df['session_id'].values  # Session identifier

# Stratified ensures balanced class distribution
gkf = GroupKFold(n_splits=5)

for fold, (train_idx, test_idx) in enumerate(gkf.split(X, y, groups=groups)):
    X_train, X_test = X[train_idx], X[test_idx]
    y_train, y_test = y[train_idx], y[test_idx]
    
    # Train model on this fold
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    
    # Evaluate on held-out fold
    accuracy = model.score(X_test, y_test)
    print(f"Fold {fold}: {accuracy:.2%}")
```

**Key Properties:**

1. **Group-based splitting**: All samples from a single gesture instance stay together (no leakage)
2. **Stratification**: Each fold maintains the same class distribution as the full dataset
3. **5-fold validation**: Every sample is tested exactly once, trained on 4 times

**Mathematical Justification:**

K-fold cross-validation provides an unbiased estimate of generalization error:

$$
\text{CV Error} = \frac{1}{K}\sum_{i=1}^{K} L(\hat{f}^{(-i)}(X_i), y_i)
$$

Where $\hat{f}^{(-i)}$ is the model trained on all folds except $i$, and $L$ is the loss function (e.g., 0-1 loss for classification accuracy).

This estimator has lower variance than a single train/test split because it averages over multiple data partitions.

### Strategy 3: Temporal Holdout for Final Evaluation

For the **final model evaluation** reported in Section 7, I reserved a **completely separate test session**:

- **Training sessions**: Data collected October 1-15, 2025 (~4,500 samples)
- **Test session**: Data collected October 17, 2025 (~500 samples, held out during development)

This simulates real deployment: the model has never seen any data from this session during training or hyperparameter tuning.

**Critical Detail**: The test session includes **different gesture ordering** and **different performance speeds** (I intentionally varied my motion cadence to test robustness).

## Class Balance: The Hidden Bias in "Idle" Gestures

One insidious problem in gesture recognition is **class imbalance**. Here's the distribution in my raw data:

| Gesture | Sample Count | Percentage |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Idle | 1,500 | 30% |
| Walk | 1,200 | 24% |
| Jump | 400 | 8% |
| Punch | 500 | 10% |
| Turn Left | 600 | 12% |
| Turn Right | 600 | 12% |
| Dash | 100 | 2% |
| Block | 100 | 2% |

**Problem**: The classifier can achieve 30% accuracy by always predicting "idle." It would be terrible at actual gesture recognition but look decent on paper.

**Solution**: Oversample minority classes during training:

```python
from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE

# Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique
smote = SMOTE(sampling_strategy='auto', random_state=42)
X_resampled, y_resampled = smote.fit_resample(X_train, y_train)
```

**How SMOTE Works:**

For each minority class sample $x_i$:
1. Find its $k$ nearest neighbors in feature space (typically $k=5$)
2. Randomly select one neighbor $x_j$
3. Generate synthetic sample along the line segment:

$$
x_{\text{synthetic}} = x_i + \lambda (x_j - x_i), \quad \lambda \sim \text{Uniform}(0, 1)
$$

This creates "plausible" new examples that interpolate between existing ones, balancing the dataset without duplicating exact samples (which would overfit).

**Result After SMOTE:**

All classes now have ~1,200 samples each. This forces the model to actually learn gesture patterns rather than exploiting class frequency.

## Validation Metrics: Why Accuracy is Insufficient

For imbalanced multiclass problems, **accuracy is a misleading metric**. Consider a model that perfectly classifies 7 classes but always fails on "dash":

$$
\text{Accuracy} = \frac{\text{TP} + \text{TN}}{\text{Total}} = \frac{4900}{5000} = 98\%
$$

Looks great! But the model is useless for detecting dashes (0% recall on that class).

**Better Metrics:**

1. **Per-Class Precision and Recall:**

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Precision}_c &= \frac{\text{TP}_c}{\text{TP}_c + \text{FP}_c} && \text{(Of predicted class $c$, how many were correct?)} \\
\text{Recall}_c &= \frac{\text{TP}_c}{\text{TP}_c + \text{FN}_c} && \text{(Of actual class $c$, how many did we find?)}
\end{aligned}
$$

2. **F1-Score (Harmonic Mean):**

$$
F1_c = 2 \cdot \frac{\text{Precision}_c \cdot \text{Recall}_c}{\text{Precision}_c + \text{Recall}_c}
$$

3. **Macro-Averaged F1 (Treats All Classes Equally):**

$$
F1_{\text{macro}} = \frac{1}{C}\sum_{c=1}^{C} F1_c
$$

Where $C$ is the number of classes (8 in our case).

**Confusion Matrix** (Section 7) visualizes exactly where the model confuses gestures, revealing systematic errors (e.g., "jump" misclassified as "punch" due to similar acceleration profiles).

## The Reality of Data Collection: What the Papers Don't Tell You

Academic papers make data collection sound sterile and systematic. The reality is messier.

**What Actually Happened:**

- Session 1 (Oct 1): Collected 800 samples, realized I was unconsciously telegraphing gestures by speaking their names *before* performing them. Data contaminated—deleted.
  
- Session 2 (Oct 3): Collected 1,200 samples, post-processing revealed microphone was clipping (audio distortion). WhisperX transcription failed on 40% of samples. Salvaged 720 usable samples.

- Session 3-5 (Oct 5-10): Collected 3,500 samples with corrected audio gain. Discovered I naturally perform "turn" gestures faster than "jump" gestures—duration mismatch creates window alignment issues. Had to manually adjust labeling thresholds.

- Session 6 (Oct 15): Collected 500 samples while intentionally tired (after cycling workout) to capture realistic fatigue effects.

- Session 7 (Oct 17): Holdout test session—performed gestures at half-speed and double-speed to test model robustness.

**Lesson**: Data quality matters infinitely more than model complexity. I spent 70% of project time on data collection and cleaning, 20% on feature engineering, and only 10% on model training. This is typical for real-world ML.

## Code Implementation: Complete Split Pipeline

Here's the actual data splitting code used for training:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import GroupKFold
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE

def prepare_training_data(csv_path, binary=False):
    """
    Loads data, performs splits, and applies preprocessing.
    
    Args:
        csv_path: Path to labeled sensor data CSV
        binary: If True, binary classification (walk/idle)
                If False, multiclass (8 gestures)
    
    Returns:
        X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test (NumPy arrays)
        scaler (fitted StandardScaler object)
    """
    # Load data
    df = pd.read_csv(csv_path)
    
    # Extract features (assumes precomputed feature columns)
    feature_cols = [col for col in df.columns if col.startswith(('accel', 'gyro'))]
    X = df[feature_cols].values
    
    # Extract labels
    if binary:
        # Binary: 0=idle, 1=walk
        y = df['gesture'].map({'idle': 0, 'walk': 1}).values
    else:
        # Multiclass: 0-7 mapping
        gesture_map = {
            'jump': 0, 'punch': 1, 'turn_left': 2, 'turn_right': 3,
            'dash': 4, 'block': 5, 'walk': 6, 'idle': 7
        }
        y = df['gesture'].map(gesture_map).values
    
    # Group by session to prevent leakage
    groups = df['session_id'].values
    
    # Stratified group k-fold split
    gkf = GroupKFold(n_splits=5)
    train_idx, test_idx = next(gkf.split(X, y, groups=groups))
    
    X_train, X_test = X[train_idx], X[test_idx]
    y_train, y_test = y[train_idx], y[test_idx]
    
    # Balance classes with SMOTE (training set only!)
    smote = SMOTE(random_state=42)
    X_train, y_train = smote.fit_resample(X_train, y_train)
    
    # Normalize features
    scaler = StandardScaler()
    X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
    X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)
    
    return X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test, scaler
```

**Design Choices Explained:**

1. **`GroupKFold`**: Prevents temporal leakage
2. **SMOTE on training only**: Prevents synthetic samples from contaminating test set
3. **Scaler fitted on training**: Prevents test set statistics from leaking into normalization
4. **Return scaler object**: Needed for deployment to transform incoming real-time data
