# CS156 Assignment Sections - Revised Edition

## Overview

This directory contains revised assignment documentation focusing exclusively on the working implementation in `/main/`. The documentation describes the actual SVM-based gesture recognition system that successfully trains and deploys for real-time game control.

## What Changed

This revision:
- **Focuses only on `/main/` code** - The actual working system with button-collected data and SVM models
- **Removes speculative content** - No references to archive experiments or untested approaches
- **Uses straightforward technical writing** - Clear, factual descriptions without editorializing
- **Documents what exists** - Based on actual files: `SVM_Local_Training.py`, `udp_listener_dashboard.py`, trained models

## Documentation Structure

All 10 sections cover the complete ML pipeline:

1. **Data Explanation** - Button-collected CSV files from Pixel Watch
2. **Data Loading** - CSV parsing and feature extraction implementation
3. **Feature Engineering** - 48 statistical features (time + frequency domain)
4. **Analysis & Splits** - Stratified train/test split, evaluation metrics
5. **Model Selection** - SVM with RBF kernel, mathematical formulation
6. **Training** - Training procedure, separate binary/multiclass models
7. **Predictions & Metrics** - Accuracy, precision, recall, confusion matrices
8. **Results** - Performance analysis, limitations, future work
9. **Executive Summary** - Complete pipeline diagram, key results
10. **References** - 25 technical references (libraries, papers, docs)

## Key Characteristics

**Mathematical rigor**: LaTeX equations for SVM, feature extraction, evaluation metrics

**Code examples**: Direct excerpts from working code in `/main/src/` and `/main/notebooks/`

**Performance data**: Actual results from trained models (85-90% binary, 70-80% multiclass)

**Deployment focus**: Real-time inference with `udp_listener_dashboard.py`

## Usage

These sections can be:
- Compiled into a Jupyter notebook
- Concatenated into a single markdown document
- Converted to PDF using pandoc
- Used as-is for reference

### PDF Generation

```bash
cd assignment/sections
cat section_*.md > ../complete_assignment.md
cd ..
pandoc complete_assignment.md -o CS156_Assignment.pdf --toc
```
